Its purpose is to help you use R effectively for applied marketing analytics, not to provide a comprehensive or theoretical treatment of the R language. The focus is on learning how to run analyses, interpret results, and apply methods to real marketing problems. This book is intentionally practical and course-driven. Chapters are designed to support lab assignments, projects, and examples used throughout the semester. What this book is (and is not) This book is: A guided introduction to R and RStudio for marketing analytics A reference for the types of analyses used in MKT 4320 A practical companion to lab assignments and course projects This book is not: A complete R programming textbook A reference for every possible R function or package A substitute for reading lab instructions carefully You are not expected to memorize R syntax. You are expected to run code, modify examples, interpret output, and explain results. The MKT4320BGSU package Many examples in this book rely on the MKT4320BGSU R package. This package contains: Custom functions used in the course Datasets for labs and demonstrations Tools designed specifically for teaching marketing analytics Because the package is actively maintained, this book may be updated over time to reflect changes in functions, workflows, or best practices. How to use this book Most weeks, you will use this book alongside a lab assignment. A typical workflow looks like this: Read the relevant sections of the book Open the corresponding lab file Run the example code Modify the code to answer lab questions Interpret results and write conclusions Code examples are meant to be run. Errors are normal and are part of the learning process. A note on updates This book is a living document. Content may be revised, expanded, or clarified as the course progresses or as the supporting R package evolves. When updates occur, they are intended to improve clarity, consistency, or alignment with course objectives. Acknowledgments Portions of this material are adapted from a variety of sources, including R documentation, textbooks, online tutorials, and teaching materials developed over time. Where appropriate, sources are noted within individual chapters. What’s next The first chapter covers Setup, including how to install and configure R, RStudio, and the required packages for the course. From there, the book moves into core R fundamentals and then into the specific analytical methods used in marketing analytics. "],["setup.html", "Chapter 1 Setup 1.1 What you need 1.2 R and RStudio (quick overview) 1.3 Navigating RStudio 1.4 Installing and loading packages 1.5 Installing the MKT4320BGSU package 1.6 Getting help when you’re stuck 1.7 How you’ll use this book 1.8 What’s next", " Chapter 1 Setup 1.1 What you need To work through this book, you will need: Access to R/RStudio An internet connection (for installing packages) A basic familiarity with saving and opening files on your computer 1.2 R and RStudio (quick overview) R is the language that runs your analysis. RStudio is the interface you use to write code, run code, view plots, and manage files. You have three options for using R/RStudio: Use OSC Classroom On Demand Using the OSC Classroom on Demand is by far the easiest way to use R/RStudio for this course. All packages (see below for more info on packages) should already be loaded and tested to ensure compatability. Install on your own machine This option involves two steps. First, install “base” R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): https://cran.r-project.org/. Second, install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download. Use a computer in an on-campus computer lab. This option should be considered a last resort. I cannot guarantee all packages will be able to be installed on university machines, and you would need to install the packages every time you use the machine. 1.3 Navigating RStudio RStudio’s interface is typically organized into four main panes in a default layout: the Source Editor, the R Console, the Environment/History, and the Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer pane. Source (usually top-left) This pane is where you write, edit, and save your R scripts or R Markdown files. It functions like a text editor with features like syntax highlighting and code completion. Code is not executed immediately upon typing. You must explicitly send lines or sections of code to the Console (commonly using the “Run” button or keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+Enter on Windows/Linux or Cmd+Enter on Mac) to execute them. This pane only appears when you have a file open. Console (usually bottom-left) This pane is where commands are actually run and text-based output, warnings, or error messages are displayed. You can type R commands directly into the console for immediate execution. The console shows a &gt; prompt when it is ready to accept a new command. Commands typed directly here are not saved automatically, which is why writing in the Source editor is recommended for complete analyses. Environments (usually top-right) This pane helps manage your current R session and the objects within it. It may contain several tabs, including: Environment Tab: Displays all the active objects (e.g., data frames, variables, functions, vectors) you’ve created or loaded during your current R session. You can inspect brief summaries of these objects here. History Tab: Provides a log of all the commands that have been successfully executed in the console, which can be useful for reviewing past work. Other Tabs: May also include tabs for Connections, Build, or Tutorials, depending on your RStudio configuration. Output (usually top-right) This multi-purpose pane provides access to various tools for project management and output viewing Files: A file browser for navigating your computer’s directory structure and managing files within your current working directory. Plots: Where all the visualizations and graphs you create with R code will be displayed. It also may contain several tab, including: Packages: Lists all installed R packages and allows you to install new ones or load them into your current session. Help: The built-in documentation browser for R functions and packages. You can search for help directly here or by using a command like ?function_name in the console. Viewer: Used for displaying local web content, such as interactive HTML outputs, Shiny apps, or interactive plots generated by certain packages. Plots: Use for displaying static plots generated by code. The layout of these panes can be customized via the Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Pane Layout menu. For more information on the panes in RStudio, please visit https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/ui-panes.html. 1.4 Installing and loading packages Packages extend R. You typically: Install a package once per computer Load the package each time you start a new R session 1.4.1 Install packages (one-time) Packages are installed using the install.packages(\"package_name\") function. For example, run the code below in the Console. If you see messages scrolling by, that is normal. install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) 1.4.2 Load packages (each session) Packages are loaded using the library(package_name) function. You may see messages and/or warnings scroll by when loading package, which is normal behavior. library(tidyverse) library(devtools) 1.5 Installing the MKT4320BGSU package The MKT4320BGSU package contains the functions and datasets used throughout this course. 1.5.1 Install from GitHub devtools::install_github(&quot;jdmeyer73/MKT4320BGSU&quot;) 1.5.2 Load the package library(MKT4320BGSU) 1.5.3 Verify everything works If the chunks below run without errors, you are set. data(&quot;directmktg&quot;) head(directmktg) # A tibble: 6 × 5 userid age buy gender salary &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 15624510 19 No Male 19 2 15810944 35 No Male 20 3 15668575 26 No Female 43 4 15603246 27 No Female 57 5 15804002 19 No Male 76 6 15728773 27 No Male 58 1.6 Getting help when you’re stuck These are the most useful help tools in R: ?function_name opens help for a function help.search(\"keyword\") searches help files If an error happens, read the last line carefully (it often tells you what to fix) Examples: ?mean help.search(&quot;logistic regression&quot;) 1.7 How you’ll use this book Most weeks, your workflow will look like this: Read the relevant sections of the book Open the lab file for the week Run the example code Modify the code to answer lab questions Interpret results and write conclusions Errors are normal—debugging is part of learning analytics. 1.8 What’s next In the next chapter, we’ll cover basic R fundamentals you’ll use constantly, including: objects and assignment vectors and data frames common functions importing data and basic data manipulation li p { margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; } "],["r-basics.html", "Chapter 2 R Basics 2.1 Basics of R Commands 2.2 Operators 2.3 Objects and assignment 2.4 Vectors 2.5 Data frames 2.6 Indexing and sequencing 2.7 Common functions 2.8 Missing (and Other Interesting) Values 2.9 Factors 2.10 What’s next", " Chapter 2 R Basics This chapter introduces the core R concepts you will use throughout the course. The goal is not to be exhaustive, but to give you enough familiarity with R’s basic building blocks so that later analytical methods make sense. By the end of this chapter, you should be comfortable creating objects, working with vectors and data frames, indexing data, and performing simple data manipulation tasks. 2.1 Basics of R Commands R is case sensitive When using the console, use the keyboard  ↑  and  ↓  arrow keys to easily cycle through previous commands typed. When using the text editor (i.e., a script file) in the source pane, use the Ctrl+Enter (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Enter (Mac) keyboard shortcut to submit a line of code directly to the console. The entire line does not need to be highlighted; the cursor needs to be anywhere on the line to be submitted. When using the text editor/script file, the “#” symbol signifies a comment Everything after is ignored It can be on the same line: x &lt;- 100 # Assign 100 to x It can be on separate lines: # Assign 100 to x x &lt;- 100 2.2 Operators Mathematical and logical operators are used frequently. Table 2.1: R Operators Description Operator Mathematical addition \\(+\\) subtraction \\(-\\) multiplication \\(*\\) division \\(/\\) exponentiation ^ or \\(**\\) Logical less than &lt; less than or equal to &lt;= greater than &gt; greater than or equal to &gt;= exactly equal to == not equal to != Not x !x x OR y x|y x AND y x&amp;y test if X is TRUE isTRUE(x) 2.3 Objects and assignment In R, almost everything you work with is an object. Objects store values, data, or results from functions. You create objects using the assignment operator &lt;-. In an RStudio script file or in the console, you can use a keyboard shortcut to produce the assignment operator. For Windows/Linux, Alt + -. For Mac, Option + -. x &lt;- 10 x [1] 10 You can overwrite objects by assigning a new value: x &lt;- 25 x [1] 25 As stated before, object names are case sensitive x &lt;- 100 X Error: ! object &#39;X&#39; not found 2.4 Vectors A vector is a collection of values of the same type. 2.4.1 Creating vectors Vectors are aften created using the concatenate function, c(item1, item2, ...) ages &lt;- c(18, 21, 25, 30) ages [1] 18 21 25 30 Common vector types include: Numeric Character Logical names &lt;- c(&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Jamie&quot;, &quot;Taylor&quot;, &quot;Pat&quot;) passed &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) The class of a vector can be checked with the class(ojbect_name) or str(object_name) function. class(ages) [1] &quot;numeric&quot; str(names) chr [1:4] &quot;Alex&quot; &quot;Jamie&quot; &quot;Taylor&quot; &quot;Pat&quot; class(passed) [1] &quot;logical&quot; Vectors can only hold a single class/type of value. When multiple classes are included, the values are coerced to the most general type. mixed &lt;- c(1, FALSE, 3.5, &quot;Hello!&quot;) mixed [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;FALSE&quot; &quot;3.5&quot; &quot;Hello!&quot; class(mixed) [1] &quot;character&quot; The c() function can be used to add to existing vectors, or combine vectors. Type coercion will be applied as needed. ages2 &lt;- c(ages, 29, 24) ages [1] 18 21 25 30 ages2 [1] 18 21 25 30 29 24 ages_names &lt;- c(ages, names) ages_names [1] &quot;18&quot; &quot;21&quot; &quot;25&quot; &quot;30&quot; &quot;Alex&quot; &quot;Jamie&quot; &quot;Taylor&quot; &quot;Pat&quot; class(ages_names) [1] &quot;character&quot; 2.4.2 Vectorized operations R is vectorized, meaning operations apply to all elements at once. ages [1] 18 21 25 30 ages + 1 [1] 19 22 26 31 ages * 2 [1] 36 42 50 60 2.4.3 Vector Length The number of items in a vector can be checked with the length(object_name) function, but can also be seen using the str(object_name) function from earlier. length(ages2) [1] 6 str(ages2) num [1:6] 18 21 25 30 29 24 2.5 Data frames A data frame is a table where: Each column is a variable Each row is an observation Data frames are the most common way to handle data sets and to provide data to statistical functions. Data frames can be created using the data.frame(objects) function: # Creating a data frame all in one step students &lt;- data.frame( id = 1:4, age = c(18, 21, 25, 30), major = c(&quot;MKT&quot;, &quot;FIN&quot;, &quot;MKT&quot;, &quot;MKT&quot;)) students id age major 1 1 18 MKT 2 2 21 FIN 3 3 25 MKT 4 4 30 MKT # Creating a data frame by combining vectors new_students &lt;- data.frame(c(names,ages,passed)) new_students c.names..ages..passed. 1 Alex 2 Jamie 3 Taylor 4 Pat 5 18 6 21 7 25 8 30 9 TRUE 10 FALSE 11 TRUE 12 TRUE You will work with data frames constantly in this course. 2.6 Indexing and sequencing Indexing is used to obtain particular elements of a data structure (vectors, matrices, data frames). Sequences are useful for indexing and loops. 2.6.1 Indexing vectors Use square brackets [] to select elements. ages[1] [1] 18 ages[2:4] [1] 21 25 30 Logical indexing is also common: ages[ages &gt; 21] [1] 25 30 2.6.2 Sequencing Use the #:# coding or the seq(from = , to = , by = ) function to create a sequence. 1:10 [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.2) [1] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 seq(0,100,10) [1] 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 2.7 Common functions Functions take inputs (arguments) and return outputs. Examples of commonly used functions: mean(ages) [1] 23.5 min(ages) [1] 18 max(ages) [1] 30 summary(ages) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 18.00 20.25 23.00 23.50 26.25 30.00 To learn about a function: ?mean 2.8 Missing (and Other Interesting) Values In R, missing values are assigned a special constant, NA. NA is not a character value, but a type of its own. Any math performed on a value of NA becomes NA. ages_missing &lt;- c(ages, NA, NA) ages_missing [1] 18 21 25 30 NA NA mean(ages_missing) [1] NA However, many commands contain a option, na.rm=TRUE, to ignore NA data when performing the function. mean(ages_missing, na.rm=TRUE) [1] 23.5 R also has special types for infinity, Inf, and undefined numbers (i.e., “not a number”), NaN. To see this in action, take the natural log, log(), of certain numbers. Notice that R provides a warning when the NaN is found. log(-1) # Not a number Warning in log(-1): NaNs produced [1] NaN log(0) # Infinity [1] -Inf 2.9 Factors Character data can be converted into nominal factors using the as.factor(object_name) function. Each unique character value will be a level of the factor. Behind the scenes, R stores the values as integers, with a separate list of labels. When the data type is set as a factor, R knows how to handle it appropriately in the model. The levels can be accessed with the levels(object_name) function. school_year &lt;- c(&quot;JR&quot;, &quot;SR&quot;, &quot;SR&quot;, &quot;SO&quot;, &quot;FR&quot;, &quot;JR&quot;) class(school_year) [1] &quot;character&quot; school_year &lt;- as.factor(school_year) str(school_year) Factor w/ 4 levels &quot;FR&quot;,&quot;JR&quot;,&quot;SO&quot;,..: 2 4 4 3 1 2 levels(school_year) [1] &quot;FR&quot; &quot;JR&quot; &quot;SO&quot; &quot;SR&quot; 2.10 What’s next In the next chapter, we focus on using functions effectively in R. You will learn how to: pass arguments to functions, work with positional versus named arguments, understand default values, and read function documentation more efficiently. These skills are essential for working with both built-in R functions and the custom functions provided in the MKT4320BGSU package. "],["functions-in-r.html", "Chapter 3 Functions in R 3.1 Function arguments 3.2 Positional vs named arguments 3.3 Default argument values 3.4 Mixing positional and named arguments 3.5 Viewing function documentation 3.6 Common mistakes to avoid 3.7 Key takeaway 3.8 What’s next", " Chapter 3 Functions in R Most of what you do in R involves using functions. A function takes inputs (called arguments), performs an operation, and returns an output. You have already used several functions, such as mean(), summary(), and seq(). mean(ages) [1] 23.5 summary(ages) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 18.00 20.25 23.00 23.50 26.25 30.00 3.1 Function arguments Functions often require one or more arguments. For example: mean(ages) [1] 23.5 Here, ages is passed to the function mean() as its first argument. Some functions require multiple arguments: seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.2) [1] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 3.2 Positional vs named arguments Arguments can be passed to a function in two ways. 3.2.1 Positional arguments If arguments are supplied in the correct order, you do not need to name them. seq(0, 1, 0.2) [1] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 This works because R knows the expected order of arguments for seq(): from to by Positional arguments are concise, but they can make code harder to read and easier to misuse. 3.2.2 Named arguments (recommended) You can explicitly name arguments using argument = value. seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.2) [1] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Advantages of named arguments: Code is easier to read Order does not matter Fewer mistakes when functions have many arguments For example, this works even though the order is different: seq(by = 0.2, to = 1, from = 0) [1] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 In this course, naming arguments is recommended, especially for complex functions. 3.3 Default argument values Many function arguments have default values. If you do not specify them, R uses the default. Example: mean(ages) [1] 23.5 The function mean() has optional arguments such as na.rm, which defaults to FALSE. mean(ages, na.rm = TRUE) [1] 23.5 You only need to specify arguments when: You want a non-default behavior The function requires the argument 3.4 Mixing positional and named arguments You can mix positional and named arguments, but positional arguments must come first. This is valid mean(ages, na.rm = TRUE) [1] 23.5 This will result in an error. mean(na.rm = TRUE, ages) [1] 23.5 A good rule of thumb: Use positional arguments for the main input Use named arguments for options and settings 3.5 Viewing function documentation To understand how a function works and what arguments it accepts, use the help system. ?mean The help page shows: What the function does Required and optional arguments Default values Examples When in doubt, read the argument list first. 3.6 Common mistakes to avoid Forgetting parentheses. This refers to the function itself, not the result.: mean function (x, ...) UseMethod(&quot;mean&quot;) &lt;bytecode: 0x000002c328f57900&gt; &lt;environment: namespace:base&gt; Misspelling argument names: mean(ages, na_remove = TRUE) [1] 23.5 Assuming argument order without checking documentation 3.7 Key takeaway You do not need to memorize every function or argument. Instead, focus on: Understanding what a function expects as input Knowing when to use named arguments Reading help files when unsure These habits will make your R code more readable, more reliable, and easier to debug. 3.8 What’s next In the next chapter, we turn to working with course data. You will learn how to: inspect and understand real datasets used in the course, distinguish between numeric and factor variables, identify missing or problematic values, and perform basic data manipulation using the dplyr package. These skills will allow you to move from isolated examples to analyzing complete datasets and will serve as the foundation for descriptive analysis, visualization, and modeling later in the semester. "],["working-with-data.html", "Chapter 4 Working with Data 4.1 Course data vs importing data 4.2 Inspecting datasets and variables 4.3 Data frames, variables, and indexing 4.4 Data transformations (base R) 4.5 What’s next", " Chapter 4 Working with Data This chapter focuses on working with real datasets used throughout the course. You will learn how course data are made available, how to inspect and understand variables, and how to perform basic data transformations using the dplyr package. The goal is to help you move from small, isolated examples to working confidently with full datasets. 4.1 Course data vs importing data In this course, many datasets are provided directly through the MKT4320BGSU package. These datasets are accessed using the data() function. For the next two chapters, we’ll be using the directmktg dataset. data(&quot;directmktg&quot;) Using data() has several advantages: Everyone is working with the same dataset No file paths are required Fewer import-related errors When possible, labs will rely on datasets loaded with data(). 4.1.1 Importing external data In some cases, you may work with your own data files (e.g., CSV files). mydata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;mydata.csv&quot;) Imported data behave the same way as course datasets once they are loaded into R. The key difference is how they enter your workspace. As a general rule: Use data() for course-provided datasets Use read.csv() (or similar functions) for your own files 4.2 Inspecting datasets and variables Before analyzing data, it is critical to understand what is in the dataset. 4.2.1 Viewing the data The head(data_object) first few rows (the default is n=6) and helps you understand the structure of the data. There is a similar function, tail(), that looks at the last n rows. head(directmktg) userid age buy gender salary 1 15624510 19 No Male 19 2 15810944 35 No Male 20 3 15668575 26 No Female 43 4 15603246 27 No Female 57 5 15804002 19 No Male 76 6 15728773 27 No Male 58 head(directmktg, n=5) userid age buy gender salary 1 15624510 19 No Male 19 2 15810944 35 No Male 20 3 15668575 26 No Female 43 4 15603246 27 No Female 57 5 15804002 19 No Male 76 tail(directmktg, n=5) userid age buy gender salary 396 15691863 46 Yes Female 41 397 15706071 51 Yes Male 23 398 15654296 50 Yes Female 20 399 15755018 36 No Male 33 400 15594041 49 Yes Female 36 To see the entire data object, you can use the View(data_object) function, which will open the data in a spreadsheet-like format in the Source pane. View(directmktg) 4.2.2 Dataset structure The str(object) function is one of the most important commands in R.

In R, you will often need to reference a specific variable (column) or select a subset of rows/columns. 4.3.1 Accessing a variable (a column) Use the $ operator to access a column by name. directmktg$age [1] 19 35 26 27 19 27 27 32 25 35 26 26 20 32 18 29 47 45 46 48 45 47 48 45 46 [26] 47 49 47 29 31 31 27 21 28 27 35 33 30 26 27 27 33 35 30 28 23 25 27 30 31 [51] 24 18 29 35 27 24 23 28 22 32 27 25 23 32 59 24 24 23 22 31 25 24 20 33 32 [76] 34 18 22 28 26 30 39 20 35 30 31 24 28 26 35 22 30 26 29 29 35 35 28 35 28 [101] 27 28 32 33 19 21 26 27 26 38 39 37 38 37 42 40 35 36 40 41 36 37 40 35 41 [126] 39 42 26 30 26 31 33 30 21 28 23 20 30 28 19 19 18 35 30 34 24 27 41 29 20 [151] 26 41 31 36 40 31 46 29 26 32 32 25 37 35 33 18 22 35 29 29 21 34 26 34 34 [176] 23 35 25 24 31 26 31 32 33 33 31 20 33 35 28 24 19 29 19 28 34 30 20 26 35 [201] 35 49 39 41 58 47 55 52 40 46 48 52 59 35 47 60 49 40 46 59 41 35 37 60 35 [226] 37 36 56 40 42 35 39 40 49 38 46 40 37 46 53 42 38 50 56 41 51 35 57 41 35 [251] 44 37 48 37 50 52 41 40 58 45 35 36 55 35 48 42 40 37 47 40 43 59 60 39 57 [276] 57 38 49 52 50 59 35 37 52 48 37 37 48 41 37 39 49 55 37 35 36 42 43 45 46 [301] 58 48 37 37 40 42 51 47 36 38 42 39 38 49 39 39 54 35 45 36 52 53 41 48 48 [326] 41 41 42 36 47 38 48 42 40 57 36 58 35 38 39 53 35 38 47 47 41 53 54 39 38 [351] 38 37 42 37 36 60 54 41 40 42 43 53 47 42 42 59 58 46 38 54 60 60 39 59 37 [376] 46 46 42 41 58 42 48 44 49 57 56 49 39 47 48 48 47 45 60 39 46 51 50 36 49 A column is often a vector, which means you can use vector functions on it. mean(directmktg$age) [1] 37.655 summary(directmktg$age) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 18.00 29.75 37.00 37.66 46.00 60.00 4.3.2 Indexing a data frame Data frames can be indexed (or subsetted) using: data[rows, cols] leave rows blank to keep all rows: data[, cols] leave cols blank to keep all columns: data[rows, ] In addition, sequencing can be used to get multiple rows and/or columns. By default, subsetting a single column returns a vector. To retain it as a data frame, use the drop = FALSE argument. directmktg[1, ] # first row, all columns directmktg[1:5, ] # first 5 rows, all columns directmktg[, 2] # all rows, column 2 only (age), as a vector directmktg[, 2, drop=FALSE] # all rows, column 2 only (age), as a data frame You can also access index columns using the column name columns. in two other ways. First, if you know the column number, you can using [[ ]] (useful when column names are stored in an object). directmktg[1, &quot;age&quot;] # first row, age column directmktg[1:5, c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;)] # first 5 rows, age and gender columns 4.3.3 Filtering rows using a condition (base R) You can filter rows by using a logical condition inside the row index. directmktg[directmktg$age &gt;= 55, ] userid age buy gender salary 65 15605000 59 No Female 83 205 15660866 58 Yes Female 101 207 15654230 55 Yes Female 130 213 15707596 59 No Female 42 216 15779529 60 Yes Female 108 220 15732987 59 Yes Male 143 224 15593715 60 Yes Male 102 228 15685346 56 Yes Male 133 244 15769596 56 Yes Female 104 248 15775590 57 Yes Female 122 259 15569641 58 Yes Female 95 263 15672821 55 Yes Female 125 272 15688172 59 Yes Female 76 273 15791373 60 Yes Male 42 275 15692819 57 Yes Female 26 276 15727467 57 Yes Male 74 281 15609669 59 Yes Female 88 293 15625395 55 Yes Male 39 301 15736397 58 Yes Female 38 335 15814553 57 Yes Male 60 337 15664907 58 Yes Male 144 356 15606472 60 Yes Male 34 366 15807525 59 Yes Female 29 367 15574372 58 Yes Female 47 371 15611430 60 Yes Female 46 372 15774744 60 Yes Male 83 374 15708791 59 Yes Male 130 380 15749381 58 Yes Female 23 385 15806901 57 Yes Female 33 386 15775335 56 Yes Male 60 394 15635893 60 Yes Male 42 This keeps only rows where age &gt;= 55. 4.3.4 Specific variable summaries (base R) You can use variable naming or indexing to get specific variable summaries using the summary() function. summary(directmktg$age) Min. 1st Qu.

This includes: creating new variables recoding variables Base R can do all of these. Even if you prefer dplyr (covered later), it is helpful to understand what is happening “under the hood.” 4.4.1 Creating a new variable This example creates a new variable in the data frame using base R. The expression on the right-hand side, directmktg$age / 10, is evaluated first. Because directmktg$age is a vector, the division is applied to each observation, and the result is a new vector of the same length. Using the assignment operator &lt;-, this new vector is stored as a column named age10 in the directmktg data frame. directmktg$age10 &lt;- directmktg$age / 10 head(directmktg, n=5) userid age buy gender salary age10 1 15624510 19 No Male 19 1.9 2 15810944 35 No Male 20 3.5 3 15668575 26 No Female 43 2.6 4 15603246 27 No Female 57 2.7 5 15804002 19 No Male 76 1.9 4.4.2 Recoding with ifelse() A common transformation is converting a categorical outcome into a numeric indicator. directmktg$buy_binary &lt;- ifelse(directmktg$buy == &quot;Yes&quot;, 1, 0) table(directmktg$buy, directmktg$buy_binary) 0 1 No 257 0 Yes 0 143 Another common recoding is converting a numeric value into categories, which can be done with nested ifelse() statements. directmktg$salary_cat &lt;- ifelse(directmktg$salary &lt;=50, &quot;Low&quot;, ifelse(directmktg$salary &lt;=80, &quot;Med&quot;, &quot;High&quot;)) head(directmktg[,c(&quot;salary&quot;,&quot;salary_cat&quot;)], 10) salary salary_cat 1 19 Low 2 20 Low 3 43 Low 4 57 Med 5 76 Med 6 58 Med 7 84 High 8 150 High 9 33 Low 10 65 Med 4.5 What’s next In the next chapter, we introduce the dplyr package for data manipulation. While the tasks performed with dplyr are similar to those you have already seen using base R, dplyr provides a more consistent and expressive way to work with data. These tools will be used extensively in later chapters for descriptive analysis, visualization, and modeling. "],["dplyr-package.html", "Chapter 5 dplyr Package 5.1 The dplyr workflow 5.2 Selecting variables 5.3 Filtering observations 5.4 Creating new variables 5.5 Summaries with summarise() 5.6 Grouped summaries with group_by() and summarise() 5.7 Connecting summarize() to base R 5.8 Combining transformations 5.9 Key takeaway 5.10 What’s next", " Chapter 5 dplyr Package In this course, data transformations are primarily performed using the dplyr package (pronounced DEE ply er). This package makes data manipulation easier and more intuitive (for most). dplyr is built around the five main “verbs” shown below that make up a majority of data manipulation. However, there are other functions that dplyr uses to also help with data manipulation. select is used to subset columns filter is used to subset rows mutate is used to add new columns based on calculations (usually with other columns) summarise is use to perform summary calculations (e.g., mean, max, etc.) on data set group_by is used to group rows of a data frame with the same value in specified columns In addition, dplyr uses the pipe, %&gt;%, to string together a series of functions. Think of functions strung together as upstream and downstream functions. The function to the left of %&gt;% is the upstream function, while the function to the right is the downstream function. By default, the downstream function assumes the value coming from the upstream function is the first argument in its function. Therefore, the first argument can be omitted. If the downstream function needs to use the value from the upstream function assigned to a different argument, a . is simply put in the position of that argument 5.1 The dplyr workflow The dplyr package is designed to make data manipulation clear and readable. library(dplyr) A typical dplyr workflow: Start with a data frame Apply a sequence of transformation verbs Save or display the result 5.2 Selecting variables Use select() to keep only the variables you need. This does not modify the original dataset unless you save the result. directmktg %&gt;% select(userid, age, gender) %&gt;% head() userid age gender 1 15624510 19 Male 2 15810944 35 Male 3 15668575 26 Female 4 15603246 27 Female 5 15804002 19 Male 6 15728773 27 Male “Negative” selection can also be done by using the - (minus sign) before a variable name or a vector of variable names. directmktg %&gt;% select(-gender) %&gt;% head() userid age buy salary age10 buy_binary salary_cat 1 15624510 19 No 19 1.9 0 Low 2 15810944 35 No 20 3.5 0 Low 3 15668575 26 No 43 2.6 0 Low 4 15603246 27 No 57 2.7 0 Med 5 15804002 19 No 76 1.9 0 Med 6 15728773 27 No 58 2.7 0 Med directmktg %&gt;% select(-c(age,gender)) %&gt;% head() userid buy salary age10 buy_binary salary_cat 1 15624510 No 19 1.9 0 Low 2 15810944 No 20 3.5 0 Low 3 15668575 No 43 2.6 0 Low 4 15603246 No 57 2.7 0 Med 5 15804002 No 76 1.9 0 Med 6 15728773 No 58 2.7 0 Med 5.3 Filtering observations Use filter() to keep rows that meet certain conditions. (Note: the nrow(object_name) from base R provides the number of rows in the data frame). nrow(directmktg) [1] 400 directmktg %&gt;% filter(age &gt;= 35) %&gt;% nrow() [1] 254 Multiple conditions can be combined: directmktg %&gt;% filter(age &gt;= 35, gender == &quot;Male&quot;) %&gt;% nrow() [1] 124 5.4 Creating new variables Use mutate() to create or transform variables. New variables are added to the data frame. directmktg %&gt;% select(userid, age) %&gt;% mutate(age10 = age / 10) %&gt;% head() userid age age10 1 15624510 19 1.9 2 15810944 35 3.5 3 15668575 26 2.6 4 15603246 27 2.7 5 15804002 19 1.9 6 15728773 27 2.7 5.5 Summaries with summarise() The summarise() function is used to compute summary statistics from a data frame. It can be used with or without grouping. When summarise() is used without group_by(), it computes summaries over the entire dataset. directmktg %&gt;% summarise( n = n(), mean_age = mean(age), buy_rate = mean(buy == &quot;Yes&quot;) ) n mean_age buy_rate 1 400 37.655 0.3575 Here’s what this code is doing: n() counts the total number of observations in the dataset mean(age) computes the overall average age mean(buy == \"Yes\") computes the overall purchase rate The result is a data frame with one row, where each column represents a summary statistic for the full dataset. 5.6 Grouped summaries with group_by() and summarise() Often, you want to compute summaries separately for different groups, such as customer segments or demographic categories. In dplyr, this is done by combining group_by() with summarize(). directmktg %&gt;% group_by(gender) # A tibble: 400 × 8 # Groups: gender [2] userid age buy gender salary age10 buy_binary salary_cat &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 15624510 19 No Male 19 1.9 0 Low 2 15810944 35 No Male 20 3.5 0 Low 3 15668575 26 No Female 43 2.6 0 Low 4 15603246 27 No Female 57 2.7 0 Med 5 15804002 19 No Male 76 1.9 0 Med 6 15728773 27 No Male 58 2.7 0 Med 7 15598044 27 No Female 84 2.7 0 High 8 15694829 32 Yes Female 150 3.2 1 High 9 15600575 25 No Male 33 2.5 0 Low 10 15727311 35 No Female 65 3.5 0 Med # ℹ 390 more rows The group_by() function does not change the data values. Instead, it tells R how the data should be temporarily divided into groups for the next operation. At this point, no calculations have been performed. Once the data are grouped, summarise() computes statistics within each group. directmktg %&gt;% group_by(gender) %&gt;% summarise( n = n(), mean_age = mean(age), buy_rate = mean(buy == &quot;Yes&quot;) ) # A tibble: 2 × 4 gender n mean_age buy_rate &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Male 196 36.9 0.337 2 Female 204 38.4 0.377 Step by step: group_by(gender) splits the data into separate groups based on gender n() counts observations within each group mean(age) computes the average age within each group mean(buy == \"Yes\") computes the purchase rate within each group The result is a data frame with one row per group and one column per summary statistic. After summarise() runs, the grouping structure is automatically dropped, so the result behaves like a regular data frame. 5.7 Connecting summarize() to base R Conceptually, grouped summaries in dplyr perform the same task as a multi-step process in base R: Split the data into groups Compute summary statistics for each group Combine the results into a table For example, in base R you might compute group means using functions such as aggregate() or by manually subsetting the data. The advantage of group_by() and summarise() is that these steps are expressed explicitly and readably, making your data transformations easier to follow, debug, and modify. 5.8 Combining transformations As you’ve seen, one of the main advantages of dplyr is that multiple steps can be chained together. directmktg_clean &lt;- directmktg %&gt;% filter(age &gt;= 35) %&gt;% mutate(age10 = age / 10, buy_binary = ifelse(buy == &quot;Yes&quot;, 1, 0)) %&gt;% select(userid, age10, gender, buy_binary) head(directmktg_clean) userid age10 gender buy_binary 1 15810944 3.5 Male 0 2 15727311 3.5 Female 0 3 15733883 4.7 Male 1 4 15617482 4.5 Male 1 5 15704583 4.6 Male 1 6 15621083 4.8 Female 1 This approach keeps data preparation transparent and reproducible. 5.9 Key takeaway Before any modeling or visualization, you should be able to: - load data reliably, - inspect variable types and values, - identify missing or problematic data, and - transform data into a usable analytical form. These steps are essential for sound marketing analytics. 5.10 What’s next In the next chapter, we will use cleaned and well-understood data to perform descriptive analysis, including frequency tables, crosstabs, measures of central tendency and dispersion, and correlation. "],["descriptive-analysis.html", "Chapter 6 Descriptive Analysis 6.1 Descriptive Analysis 6.2 Frequency Tables 6.3 Crosstabs 6.4 Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion 6.5 Correlation 6.6 Why descriptive analysis matters 6.7 What’s next", " Chapter 6 Descriptive Analysis Descriptive analysis summarizes and helps you understand your data numerically. In marketing analytics, it is often your first “sanity check” before modeling or visualization. In this chapter you will learn how to: inspect a dataset and its variables, create frequency tables and crosstabs, compute measures of central tendency and dispersion, and compute and interpret correlations. For this chapter, we’ll be using the airlinesat_small dataset from the MKT4320BGSU. data(airlinesat_small) 6.1 Descriptive Analysis A quick descriptive workflow often looks like: Confirm the data structure (rows/columns, variable types) Look for missing values and odd ranges Summarize key variables (categorical → counts; numeric → mean/SD, etc.) Compare segments (e.g., by treatment, gender, region, etc.) 6.1.1 Inspecting the dataset The following functions are useful for inspecting the dataset. str() shows each variables’ type, displays factor levels if present, and gives a compact preview of values for each variable dim() returns the number of rows and columsn to quickly tell you sample size and number of variables names() provides all column names, which helps with selecting variables for writing code or formulas head() gives the first six rows of the dataset to allow for visual inspection of raw values # Take a look at the data frame str(airlinesat_small) &#39;data.frame&#39;: 1065 obs. of 13 variables: $ age : num 30 55 56 43 44 40 39 41 33 51 ... $ country : Factor w/ 5 levels &quot;at&quot;,&quot;ch&quot;,&quot;de&quot;,..: 2 2 2 4 2 2 2 2 2 3 ... $ flight_class : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;Business&quot;,&quot;Economy&quot;,..: 2 1 2 2 1 3 2 1 2 1 ... $ flight_latest : Factor w/ 6 levels &quot;within the last 12 months&quot;,..: 4 3 5 3 6 5 6 3 3 4 ... $ flight_purpose: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Business&quot;,&quot;Leisure&quot;: 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 ... $ flight_type : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Domestic&quot;,&quot;International&quot;: 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 ... $ gender : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;: 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ language : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;English&quot;,&quot;French&quot;,..: 2 1 1 2 1 3 2 2 2 3 ... $ nflights : num 2 6 8 7 25 16 35 9 3 4 ... $ status : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;Blue&quot;,&quot;Gold&quot;,..: 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 ... $ nps : num 6 10 8 8 6 7 8 7 8 8 ... $ overall_sat : num 2 6 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 3 ... $ reputation : num 3 6 4 6 5 3 3 4 2 4 ... # Dimensions (rows, columns) dim(airlinesat_small) [1] 1065 13 # Variable names names(airlinesat_small) [1] &quot;age&quot; &quot;country&quot; &quot;flight_class&quot; &quot;flight_latest&quot; [5] &quot;flight_purpose&quot; &quot;flight_type&quot; &quot;gender&quot; &quot;language&quot; [9] &quot;nflights&quot; &quot;status&quot; &quot;nps&quot; &quot;overall_sat&quot; [13] &quot;reputation&quot; # First few rows head(airlinesat_small) age country flight_class flight_latest flight_purpose 1 30 ch Economy within the last 6 months Leisure 2 55 ch Business within the last 3 months Business 3 56 ch Economy within the last month Business 4 43 fr Economy within the last 3 months Leisure 5 44 ch Business within the last week Business 6 40 ch First within the last month Leisure flight_type gender language nflights status nps overall_sat reputation 1 Domestic male French 2 Blue 6 2 3 2 International male English 6 Gold 10 6 6 3 Domestic female English 8 Blue 8 2 4 4 Domestic female French 7 Blue 8 4 6 5 International female English 25 Gold 6 2 5 6 International male German 16 Gold 7 4 3 6.1.2 Missing values (quick checks) It is also important to check for missing values, because they can have an adverse effect on some analyses. The is.na() function is often used for this, which returns a TRUE if a value is NA. Ultimately, this will tell which values in the data are missing to help decide how to handle them. # Missing values by variable colSums(is.na(airlinesat_small)) age country flight_class flight_latest flight_purpose 0 0 0 0 0 flight_type gender language nflights status 0 0 0 0 0 nps overall_sat reputation 0 0 0 # Total missing values in the dataset sum(is.na(airlinesat_small)) [1] 0 6.2 Frequency Tables Frequency tables summarize categorical variables (and sometimes binned numeric variables). 6.2.1 One-way frequency table To create a frequency table, use the table() function in R. Counts are often converted into proportions or rates to make results easier to interpret and compare. In R, the proportions() function is used to convert frequency tables into proportions. Multiply the table by 100 to get percentages. # Frequency table for a categorical variable table(airlinesat_small$gender) female male 280 785 # Add proportions (shares) proportions(table(airlinesat_small$gender)) female male 0.2629108 0.7370892 # Add percentages 100 * proportions(table(airlinesat_small$gender)) female male 26.29108 73.70892 6.3 Crosstabs A crosstab is a frequency table for two categorical variables. Crosstabs are used frequently in marketing to compare segments (e.g., purchase by gender). 6.3.1 Base R Base R does not do a great job of easily creating crosstabs and testing for independence of the two variables. Instead, a multistep process is required: Create the two-way frequency table using the table(rowvar, colvar) function and assign it to a separate object Display the two-way freq table by just using the table name # Counts ct &lt;- table(airlinesat_small$flight_class, airlinesat_small$gender) ct female male Business 39 146 Economy 239 626 First 2 13 Use the function proportions(tablename, margin) on the newly created object to get column, row, or total percentages proportions(tablename) gives total percentages proportions(tablename, 1) gives row percentages proportions(tablename, 2) gives column percentages proportions(ct) # Total proportions: what pprportion of all respondents female male Business 0.036619718 0.137089202 Economy 0.224413146 0.587793427 First 0.001877934 0.012206573 proportions(ct, margin=1) # Row proportions: how are genders distributed within a row female male Business 0.2108108 0.7891892 Economy 0.2763006 0.7236994 First 0.1333333 0.8666667 proportions(ct, margin=2) # Column proportions: how is th outcome distributed within each gender female male Business 0.139285714 0.185987261 Economy 0.853571429 0.797452229 First 0.007142857 0.016560510 Use the function chisq.test(tablename) on the newly created object to run the test of independence chisq.test(ct) Warning in chisq.test(ct): Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test data: ct X-squared = 4.6912, df = 2, p-value = 0.09579 6.3.2 Using package sjPlot The sjPlot package can print crosstabs with nicer formatting. Use the function tab_xtab(var.row=, var.col=, show.col.prc=TRUE) to get a standard crosstab with column percentages and the chi-square test of independence. tab_xtab(airlinesat_small$flight_class, airlinesat_small$gender, show.col.prc = TRUE) flight_class gender Total female male Business 3913.9 % 14618.6 % 18517.4 % Economy 23985.4 % 62679.7 % 86581.2 % First 20.7 % 131.7 % 151.4 % Total 280100 % 785100 % 1065100 % χ2=4.691 · df=2 · Cramer’s V=0.066 · Fisher’s p=0.083 6.4 Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion For numeric variables, the most common summaries are: Central tendency: mean, median, mode Dispersion: variance, standard deviation, IQR, range 6.4.1 Base R Any individual summary statistic can be easily calculated using Base R with functions such as: mean(var) for mean sd(var) for standard deviation quantile(var, .percentile) for percentiles (e.g., ‘.50’ would be median) For summary statistics except for standard deviation, the summary(object) function can be used, where object can be a single variable or an entire data frame # Base R summary (min, quartiles, median, mean, max) summary(airlinesat_small$age) Min. 1st Qu.

Overall summaries: airlinesat_small %&gt;% summarise(n = n(), mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE), sd_age = sd(age, na.rm = TRUE), median_age = median(age, na.rm = TRUE), iqr_age = IQR(age, na.rm = TRUE), mean_nflights = mean(nflights, na.rm = TRUE), sd_nflights = sd(nflights, na.rm = TRUE)) n mean_age sd_age median_age iqr_age mean_nflights sd_nflights 1 1065 50.41972 12.27464 50 16 13.41878 20.22647 Group summaries (example: by buy): airlinesat_small %&gt;% group_by(status) %&gt;% summarise(n = n(), mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE), sd_age = sd(age, na.rm = TRUE), mean_nflights = mean(nflights, na.rm = TRUE), sd_nflights = sd(nflights, na.rm = TRUE)) # A tibble: 3 × 6 status n mean_age sd_age mean_nflights sd_nflights &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Blue 677 50.6 13.3 8.23 19.2 2 Gold 143 53 10.0 24.6 20.9 3 Silver 245 48.3 10.0 21.2 17.2 6.4.3 Using package vtable The vtable package can generate clean, compact descriptive tables with the sumtable(data, vars=c(\"\")) function. For factor variables, it will provide the counts and percents of each level. sumtable(airlinesat_small, c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;nflights&quot;, &quot;status&quot;), add.median=TRUE) # &#39;add.median=TRUE&#39; includes a 50th percentile column (#tab:vtable_sumtable)Summary Statistics Variable N Mean Std.

The most common is Pearson correlation (the default). 6.5.1 Base R Base R can easily provide a correlation matrix of many variables, and it can provide a correlation test between two variables at a time, but it cannot produce a correlation matrix with p-values. To get a correlation matrix, use the cor() function with a dataframe of the variables desired or using indexing on variable names. By default, it uses all observations, which can create NA values if any missing values exists. Therefore, the preference is to add the option use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\" to only calculate the correlation on non-missing values for each pair of variables. mycorr_df &lt;- airlinesat_small %&gt;% select(age, nflights, nps, overall_sat, reputation) cor(mycorr_df, use = &quot;pairwise.complete.obs&quot;) age nflights nps overall_sat reputation age 1.00000000 -0.11576301 0.09867319 0.05903446 0.06082991 nflights -0.11576301 1.00000000 -0.08949782 -0.05366975 -0.06364290 nps 0.09867319 -0.08949782 1.00000000 0.29961310 0.50712230 overall_sat 0.05903446 -0.05366975 0.29961310 1.00000000 0.17748688 reputation 0.06082991 -0.06364290 0.50712230 0.17748688 1.00000000 cor(airlinesat_small[,c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;nflights&quot;, &quot;nps&quot;, &quot;overall_sat&quot;, &quot;reputation&quot;)], use = &quot;pairwise.complete.obs&quot;) age nflights nps overall_sat reputation age 1.00000000 -0.11576301 0.09867319 0.05903446 0.06082991 nflights -0.11576301 1.00000000 -0.08949782 -0.05366975 -0.06364290 nps 0.09867319 -0.08949782 1.00000000 0.29961310 0.50712230 overall_sat 0.05903446 -0.05366975 0.29961310 1.00000000 0.17748688 reputation 0.06082991 -0.06364290 0.50712230 0.17748688 1.00000000 To get the correlation test for any one pair of variables, use the cor.test(var1, var2) function. By default, it includes only observations that are non-missing in both variables. cor.test(airlinesat_small$age, airlinesat_small$nflights) Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation data: airlinesat_small$age and airlinesat_small$nflights t = -3.7998, df = 1063, p-value = 0.000153 alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.17461941 -0.05608231 sample estimates: cor -0.115763 6.5.2 Using package Hmisc The Hmisc package is useful for correlation matrices with p-values using the rcorr() function. This function expects a matrix (or data frame coerced to matrix). rcorr(as.matrix(mycorr_df)) age nflights nps overall_sat reputation age 1.00 -0.12 0.10 0.06 0.06 nflights -0.12 1.00 -0.09 -0.05 -0.06 nps 0.10 -0.09 1.00 0.30 0.51 overall_sat 0.06 -0.05 0.30 1.00 0.18 reputation 0.06 -0.06 0.51 0.18 1.00 n= 1065 P age nflights nps overall_sat reputation age 0.0002 0.0013 0.0541 0.0472 nflights 0.0002 0.0035 0.0800 0.0378 nps 0.0013 0.0035 0.0000 0.0000 overall_sat 0.0541 0.0800 0.0000 0.0000 reputation 0.0472 0.0378 0.0000 0.0000 6.5.3 Using package sjPlot The sjPlot package can produce formatted correlation tables for reports using the tab_corr() function. By default, it uses listwise (or casewise) deletion, which removes an entire case (or row) if any value is NA, which may result in major data loss. Use the option na.deletion = \"pairwise\") to prevent this. tab_corr(mycorr_df, triangle = &quot;lower&quot;, show.p = TRUE, na.deletion = &quot;pairwise&quot;)   age nflights nps overall_sat reputation age           nflights -0.116***         nps 0.099** -0.089**       overall_sat 0.059 -0.054 0.300***     reputation 0.061* -0.064* 0.507*** 0.177***   Computed correlation used pearson-method with pairwise-deletion. 6.6 Why descriptive analysis matters Descriptive statistics help you to: detect unusual values, understand typical behavior, compare groups, and check whether results are plausible. They also guide decisions about which models or visualizations are appropriate. 6.7 What’s next In the next chapter, we move from numbers to visuals. You will learn how to create effective data visualizations using a small amount of Base R, but primarily ggplot2. Visualizations allow you to see patterns, distributions, and relationships that are often difficult to detect from tables alone. Together, descriptive statistics and visualization form the foundation of exploratory data analysis, which prepares you for modeling and inference later in the course. "],["data-visualization.html", "Chapter 7 Data Visualization 7.1 Base R Visualizations 7.2 Moving Beyond Base R 7.3 Introduction to ggplot2 7.4 Summary 7.5 What’s Next", " Chapter 7 Data Visualization Descriptive statistics summarize data numerically, but visualizations often reveal patterns, trends, and anomalies more quickly. This chapter introduces basic data visualization techniques in R. We begin with Base R graphics to understand core plotting concepts, then move to ggplot2, which provides a more flexible and powerful system for creating graphics. 7.1 Base R Visualizations Base R graphics are built into R and require no additional packages. They are useful for quick exploratory analysis and for understanding how plotting works at a fundamental level. 7.1.1 Histogram (Base R) A histogram shows the distribution of a numeric variable. Histograms are useful for assessing the shape, spread, and potential outliers in a numeric variable. hist(airlinesat_small$age, main = &quot;Histogram of Number of Age&quot;, xlab = &quot;Number of Age&quot;, col = &quot;lightgray&quot;, border = &quot;white&quot;) 7.1.2 Box-and-Whisker Plot (Base R) A box-and-whisker plot (often called a boxplot) summarizes the distribution of a numeric variable using five key values: Minimum First quartile (25th percentile) Median Third quartile (75th percentile) Maximum Boxplots are especially useful for: Comparing distributions across groups Identifying skewness Detecting potential outliers boxplot(airlinesat_small$age, main = &quot;Distribution of Age&quot;, ylab = &quot;Age&quot;, col = &quot;lightgray&quot;) 7.1.3 Scatterplot (Base R) A scatterplot displays the relationship between two numeric variables. Scatterplots are commonly used to detect relationships, nonlinear patterns, and outliers. plot(airlinesat_small$age, airlinesat_small$nflights, main = &quot;Age vs Number of Flights&quot;, xlab = &quot;Age&quot;, ylab = &quot;Number of Flights&quot;, pch = 19, col = &quot;darkgray&quot;) 7.1.4 Line Chart (Base R) Line charts are typically used for ordered data, such as time series or values summarized across an ordered variable. Line charts emphasize change across an ordered dimension rather than individual observations. First, we’ll simulate some time series data, and then we’ll create the line chart. # Simulate monthly flight data set.seed(123) months &lt;- seq(from = as.Date(&quot;2022-01-01&quot;), to = as.Date(&quot;2023-12-01&quot;), by = &quot;month&quot;) n_months &lt;- length(months) flights &lt;- round(800 + seq(0, 100, length.out = n_months) + # upward trend 80 * sin(2 * pi * (1:n_months) / 12) + # seasonality rnorm(n_months, mean = 0, sd = 40)) # random noise flight_ts &lt;- data.frame(month = months, flights = flights) # Line chart of flights by month plot(flight_ts$month, flight_ts$flights, type = &quot;l&quot;, main = &quot;Number of Flights by Month&quot;, xlab = &quot;Month&quot;, ylab = &quot;Number of Flights&quot;, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;, lwd = 2) 7.1.5 Bar Chart (Base R) Bar charts are used for categorical variables. They are useful for comparing counts or proportions across categories. They can also show results for different categories of another variable (i.e., a side-by-side bar chart). status_counts &lt;- table(airlinesat_small$status) barplot( status_counts, main = &quot;Loyalty Status&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;, col = &quot;lightblue&quot; ) status_gender_tab &lt;- table(airlinesat_small$status, airlinesat_small$gender) barplot(status_gender_tab, beside = TRUE, col = c(&quot;steelblue&quot;, &quot;darkorange&quot;), main = &quot;Loyalty Status by Gender&quot;, xlab = &quot;Loyalty Status&quot;, ylab = &quot;Number of Customers&quot;, legend.text = TRUE, args.legend = list(title = &quot;Gender&quot;, x = &quot;topright&quot;, bty = &quot;n&quot;)) 7.2 Moving Beyond Base R While Base R graphics are useful, they can become cumbersome when creating more complex plots or when consistent styling is needed. The ggplot2 package provides a structured approach to visualization based on the grammar of graphics. 7.3 Introduction to ggplot2 In ggplot2, plots are built in layers from three main components: data, aesthetic mappings (i.e., a coordinate system identifying x and y variables), and geometric objects (i.e., how the data should be displayed). In addition, the plot can be enhanced by adding additional layers using the + operator. ggplot2 also works very well with dplyr when data manipulation is needed prior to creating the plot. 7.3.1 Histogram Histograms in ggplot use the geom_histogram() layer. As with many geoms in ggplot2, no options are required in the geom. Here is a basic histogram. ggplot(airlinesat_small, aes(x = age)) + geom_histogram() `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`. One of the benefits of ggplot2 is the ease of making the plot look more visually appealing often more informative. Here is the histogram with additional options for bins, the fill color, and the outline color, along with labels using the labs layer. ggplot(airlinesat_small, aes(x = age)) + geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = &quot;orange&quot;, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Histogram of Age&quot;, x = &quot;Age&quot;, y= &quot;Count&quot;) 7.3.2 Box-and-Whiskers Plot Box Plots are drawn with the geom_boxplot() geom, which by default creates a box plot for a continuous y variable, but for each level of a discrete x variable. In addition, the standard box plot does not contain “whiskers”. To get a box plot for only the continuous y variable, use x = \"\" as the discrete x variable. To add whiskers, include a staplewidth = 1 within the geom_boxplot(). ggplot(airlinesat_small, aes(x = &quot;&quot;, y=age)) + geom_boxplot(staplewidth = 1) + labs(title=&quot;Boxplot for Age&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;Age&quot;) 7.3.2.1 Side-by-Side Boxplot To create side-by-side boxplots for a discrete variable, simply repace the x = \"\" with a variable name. ggplot(airlinesat_small, aes(x = gender, y=age)) + geom_boxplot(staplewidth = 1) + labs(title=&quot;Boxplot for Age by Gender&quot;, x = &quot;Gender&quot;, y = &quot;Age&quot;) 7.3.3 Scatterplot Scatterplots are drawn with the geom_point() geom and are used to show the relationship between two continuous variables. ggplot(airlinesat_small, aes(x = age, y = nflights)) + geom_point() + labs(title = &quot;Age vs Number of Flights&quot;, x = &quot;Age&quot;, y = &quot;Number of Flights&quot;) 7.3.3.1 Scatterplot with a Categorical Variable More interesting scatterplots can be created by changing the color of the points by a third, discrete variable. This means adding a new aesthetic in the aes() part. ggplot(airlinesat_small, aes(x = age, y = nflights, color=status)) + geom_point() + labs(title = &quot;Age vs Number of Flights by Loyalty Status&quot;, x = &quot;Age&quot;, y = &quot;Number of Flights&quot;, color = &quot;Loyalty Status&quot;) 7.3.3.2 Scatterplot with a Trendline Scatterplots become more helpful when we add a trend line. The most common trend line is a simple regression line, although others can be used. Use geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) to add a linear trend line. ggplot(airlinesat_small, aes(x = age, y = nps)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + labs(title = &quot;Age vs Number of Flights&quot;, x = &quot;Age&quot;, y = &quot;Number of Flights&quot;) `geom_smooth()` using formula = &#39;y ~ x&#39; 7.3.4 Line Chart Line charts are drawn with the geom_line() geom and are used to emphasize change across an ordered dimension rather than individual observations. We’ll use the simulated data from the line chart in base R created above. ggplot(flight_ts, aes(x = month, y = flights)) + geom_line() 7.3.5 Bar Chart In ggplot2, bar charts, geom_bar(), are often used for plotting a single discrete variable, while column charts, geom_col(), are used for plotting a discrete variable on the x axis and a continuous variable on the y axis. However, geom_col() can be used for both if the data is “preformatted”, which is easy with dplyr. Other than the first example below, all other examples use geom_col() as it tends to be more flexible when combined with dplyr. The second example below first organizes the data using dplyr and then passes that result to ggplot. ggplot(airlinesat_small, aes(x = gender)) + geom_bar(fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Gender&quot;, x = &quot;Gender&quot;, y = &quot;Count&quot;) airlinesat_small %&gt;% group_by(gender) %&gt;% summarise(n=n()) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = n)) + geom_col(fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Gender&quot;, x = &quot;Gender&quot;, y = &quot;Count&quot;) 7.3.5.1 Bar Charts for Continuous Variables Bar charts can be used to show a summary statistic (e.g., mean, median, etc.) of a continuous variable. This is easily done with dplyr. We can also add labels using the geom_text() or geom_label() geoms. geom_text() tends to be more flexible. By default, ggplot places the label at the exact height of the value, but that will overlap with the bar itself. Use the vjust = option to change the position of the label vertically. Usually vjust = 0.95 puts the label just inside the top of the bar, while vjust = -.05 puts the label just outside the top of the bar. You can also change the color of the label with color =, the size of the label with size =, and you can round the label to a specific number of digits with round(). airlinesat_small %&gt;% summarise(mean_age=mean(age)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = &quot;&quot;, y = mean_age)) + geom_col(fill = &quot;navyblue&quot;) + geom_text(aes(label = round(mean_age,2)), vjust = .95, color=&quot;white&quot;, size=8) + labs(title = &quot;Mean Age&quot;, x = &quot;Age&quot;, y = &quot;Mean&quot;) 7.3.6 Grouped Bar Chart When used with dplyr, it is easy to create side-by-side or stacked bar charts. In the code below, first a table is created and displayed using dplyr. Ultimately, we want to take those results pass them to a ggplot to create the chart. 7.3.6.1 Stacked Bar Chart with Counts The default is to “stack” the counts. airlinesat_small %&gt;% group_by(gender, status) %&gt;% summarise(n=n()) # A tibble: 6 × 3 # Groups: gender [2] gender status n &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 female Blue 225 2 female Gold 16 3 female Silver 39 4 male Blue 452 5 male Gold 127 6 male Silver 206 airlinesat_small %&gt;% group_by(gender, status) %&gt;% summarise(n=n()) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = n, fill = status)) + geom_col() + labs(title = &quot;Loyalty Status by Gender (Stacked Count)&quot;, x = &quot;Gender&quot;, y = &quot;Count&quot;, fill = &quot;Status&quot;) 7.3.6.2 Stacked Bar Chart with Percentages We can create “100%” stacked bar charts by calculating the percentages in the dplyr code. With the code below, the percentages will add up to 100% for the first group_by variable. airlinesat_small %&gt;% group_by(gender, status) %&gt;% summarise(n=n()) %&gt;% mutate(perc = 100 * n/sum(n)) # A tibble: 6 × 4 # Groups: gender [2] gender status n perc &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 female Blue 225 80.4 2 female Gold 16 5.71 3 female Silver 39 13.9 4 male Blue 452 57.6 5 male Gold 127 16.2 6 male Silver 206 26.2 airlinesat_small %&gt;% group_by(gender, status) %&gt;% summarise(n=n()) %&gt;% mutate(perc = 100 * n/sum(n)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = perc, fill = status)) + geom_col() + labs(title = &quot;Loyalty Status by Gender (Stacked Percent)&quot;, x = &quot;Gender&quot;, y = &quot;Percent&quot;, fill = &quot;Status&quot;) 7.3.6.3 Side-by-Side Bar Chart with Counts/Percentages To create side-by-side bar charts (vs. stacked), use the position = position_dodge(width=.9) option within the geom_col(). If you add labels, you need to use position = position_dodge(width=.9) in the geom_text, otherwise the labels will be on top of each other. airlinesat_small %&gt;% group_by(gender, status) %&gt;% summarise(n=n()) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = n, fill = status)) + geom_col(position = position_dodge(width=.9)) + geom_text(aes(label = n), position = position_dodge(width=.9), vjust = -.05) + labs(title = &quot;Loyalty Status by Gender (Side-by-Side Count)&quot;, x = &quot;Gender&quot;, y = &quot;Count&quot;, fill = &quot;Status&quot;) airlinesat_small %&gt;% group_by(status, flight_purpose) %&gt;% summarise(n = n()) %&gt;% mutate(perc = 100*n/sum(n)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = status, y = perc, fill = flight_purpose)) + geom_col(position = position_dodge(width=.9)) + geom_text(aes(label = round(perc, 2)), position = position_dodge(width=.9), vjust = -.05) + labs(title = &quot;Flight Purpose by Loyalty Status (Side-by-Side Percent)&quot;, x = &quot;Loyalty Status&quot;, y = &quot;Percent&quot;, fill = &quot;Flight Purpose&quot;) 7.3.6.4 Side-by-Side Bar Chart with Continuous Variable We can also calculate a summary statistic (e.g., mean, median, etc.) for a continuous variable and use that to create a side-by-side bar chart of a discrete variable or two discrete variables. airlinesat_small %&gt;% group_by(status) %&gt;% summarise(mean=mean(nflights)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = status, y = mean)) + geom_col(position = position_dodge(width=.9)) + geom_text(aes(label = round(mean, 2)), position = position_dodge(width=.9), vjust = .95, color=&quot;white&quot;, size=8) + labs(title = &quot;Mean Number Flights by Loyalty Status&quot;, x = &quot;Loyalty Status&quot;, y = &quot;Mean Number of Flights&quot;) airlinesat_small %&gt;% group_by(status, flight_purpose) %&gt;% summarise(mean = mean(nflights)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = status, y = mean, fill = flight_purpose)) + geom_col(position = position_dodge(width=.9)) + geom_text(aes(label = round(mean, 2)), position = position_dodge(width=.9), vjust = .95, color=&quot;white&quot;, size=6) + labs(title = &quot;Flight Number of Flights by Loyalty Status and Flight Purpose&quot;, x = &quot;Loyalty Status&quot;, y = &quot;Mean Number of Flights&quot;, fill = &quot;Flight Purpose&quot;) 7.4 Summary Base R graphics provide a simple way to create quick plots, while ggplot2 offers a more flexible and extensible framework for data visualization. In practice, Base R is useful for fast checks, and ggplot2 is preferred for exploratory analysis and communication. 7.5 What’s Next In the next chapter, we move from visual summaries to formal modeling. You will learn how to use linear regression to quantify relationships between variables, estimate marginal effects, and make predictions while holding other factors constant.

It allows us to quantify relationships between an outcome variable and one or more predictors, helping us explain variation, estimate marginal effects, and generate predictions. In earlier chapters, we summarized data numerically and visually. In this chapter, we move beyond description to modeling relationships between variables. Throughout this chapter, we use the airlinesat_small dataset and focus on interpretation rather than mathematical derivation. 8.1 The Linear Regression Model A linear regression model relates an outcome variable to one or more predictors. In R, linear regression models are estimated using the lm() function. The general structure is: lm(outcome ~ predictors, data = dataset) 8.2 Simple Linear Regression We begin with a simple linear regression model containing a single predictor. In this example, we model Net Promoter Score (nps) as a function of the number of flights taken (nflights). If we don’t ask for a summary we only get the coefficients. If we save the result as an object and then ask for a summary, we get the full, expected results. lm(nps ~ nflights, data = airlinesat_small) Call: lm(formula = nps ~ nflights, data = airlinesat_small) Coefficients: (Intercept) nflights 7.65848 -0.01031 model_simple &lt;- lm(nps ~ nflights, data = airlinesat_small) summary(model_simple) Call: lm(formula = nps ~ nflights, data = airlinesat_small) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -6.6482 -1.4318 0.4137 1.5476 8.0512 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

It easily allows us to adjust the number of digits shown (digits = # option). It can also show the standardized beta coefficients by using the scale=TRUE and transform.response=TRUE options together. summ(model_simple, digits = 4) Observations 1065 Dependent variable nps Type OLS linear regression F(1,1063) 8.5832 R² 0.0080 Adj.

Multiple linear regression allows us to include additional predictors to control for other characteristics. 8.3.1 Adding Additional Variables model_multi &lt;- lm(nps ~ nflights + age, data = airlinesat_small) summ(model_multi, digits = 4) Observations 1065 Dependent variable nps Type OLS linear regression F(2,1062) 8.5875 R² 0.0159 Adj.

In R, factor variables are automatically converted into indicator (dummy) variables. 8.4.1 Example: Flight Class model_cat &lt;- lm(nps ~ nflights + flight_class, data = airlinesat_small) summ(model_cat, digits = 4) Observations 1065 Dependent variable nps Type OLS linear regression F(3,1061) 4.1443 R² 0.0116 Adj.

Interactions can be included in the formula using * or : * will include the interaction term AND each main effect : will include ONLY the interaction term Examples: y ~ x1 + x2 * x3 is the same as: \\(y = x1 + x2 + x3 + (x2 \\times x3)\\) y ~ x1 + x2:x3 is the same as: $y = x1 + (x2 \\times x3)$ 0y ~ x1 + x2 + x2:x3` is the same as: \\(y = x1 + x2 + (x2 \\times x3)\\) 8.5.1 Example: Flights and Frequent Flier Status model_inter &lt;- lm(nps ~ age + nflights * status, data = airlinesat_small) summ(model_inter, digits = 4) Observations 1065 Dependent variable nps Type OLS linear regression F(6,1058) 5.0753 R² 0.0280 Adj.

Usage: easy_mp(model, focal, int = NULL) Arguments: model is a fitted lm model or binary logistic glm model (family = \"binomial\"). focal is the name of the focal predictor variable in quotations int is the name of the interaction variable in quotations. Can be excluded if only the focal variable is wanted or no interaction exists. Returns: - $plot is the margin plot - $ptable is the marginal effects table used to produce the plot 8.6.2 WITHOUT Interactions Below are examples of a margin plot for a continuous independent variable and for a categorical/factor independent variable. Note how the returned $plot object is a ggplot that can be modified by adding layers. model_mp_nointer &lt;- lm(nps ~ age + gender, data = airlinesat_small) # Continuous Focal WITHOUT Interaction mp_age &lt;- easy_mp(model_mp_nointer, focal=&quot;age&quot;) mp_age$plot + labs(title=&quot;No Interaction: Continuous Variable&quot;) # Factor Focal WITHOUT Interaction mp_gender &lt;- easy_mp(model_mp_nointer, focal=&quot;gender&quot;) mp_gender$plot + labs(title=&quot;No Interaction: Factor Variable&quot;) 8.6.3 WITH Interactions Ultimately, there are four types of margin plots that can be created depending on the focal variable type and the interaction variable type: Continuous Focal IV \\(\\times\\) Continuous Interaction IV Continuous Focal IV \\(\\times\\) Factor Interaction IV Factor Focal IV \\(\\times\\) Continuous Interaction IV Factor Focal IV \\(\\times\\) Factor Interaction IV When the interaction term is continuous, the plot is created with representative values of the continuous variable (roughly the 1st percentile, the 99th percentile, and two evenly spaced values between those two). model_mp_inter &lt;- lm(nps ~ age*gender + age*reputation + gender*status, data = airlinesat_small) # Continuous Focal WITH Continuous Interaction mp_age_reputation &lt;- easy_mp(model_mp_inter, focal = &quot;age&quot;, int = &quot;reputation&quot;) mp_age_reputation$plot + labs(title=&quot;Interaction: Continuous Focal IV by Continuous Interaction IV&quot;) # Continuous Focal WITH Factor Interaction mp_age_gender &lt;- easy_mp(model_mp_inter, focal = &quot;age&quot;, int = &quot;gender&quot;) mp_age_gender$plot + labs(title=&quot;Interaction: Continuous Focal IV by Factor Interaction IV&quot;) # Factor Focal WITH Continuous Interaction mp_gender_age &lt;- easy_mp(model_mp_inter, focal = &quot;gender&quot;, int = &quot;age&quot;) mp_gender_age$plot + labs(title=&quot;Interaction: Factor Focal IV by Continuous Interaction IV&quot;) # Factor Focal WITH Factor Interaction mp_gender_status &lt;- easy_mp(model_mp_inter, focal = &quot;gender&quot;, int = &quot;status&quot;) mp_gender_status$plot + labs(title=&quot;Interaction: Factor Focal IV by Factor Interaction IV&quot;) 8.7 Prediction Regression models can also be used for prediction. The function predict() can be used to predict the DV based on values of the IVs. We can either: (1) predict the expected value of the DV for each observation in the data, or (2) predict the expected value of the DV for new values of the IV(s). To use this function for (2), we must pass a data frame of values to the function, where the data frame contains ALL of the IVs and the value for each IV that we want. Suppose we wanted to predict, with a confidence interval, the nps of someone that is 45 years old and had 25 flights on the airline, and also someone that is 25 years old and had 45 flights on the airline, based on our model_multi &lt;- lm(nps ~ nflights + age, data = airlinesat_small) from above. First, we create the data frame of values values &lt;- data.frame(age=c(45, 25), nflights=c(25, 45)) values age nflights 1 45 25 2 25 45 Second, the data frame is passed to the predict() function with confidence intervals requested. predict(model_multi, values, interval=&quot;confidence&quot;) fit lwr upr 1 7.322601 7.153951 7.491252 2 6.800657 6.431058 7.170255 8.8 What’s Next In this chapter, you learned how to use linear regression to model relationships when the outcome variable is continuous, such as satisfaction or Net Promoter Score. Linear regression works well when predicted values can reasonably fall anywhere along a numeric scale. Many marketing outcomes, however, are binary—for example, purchase vs. no purchase, churn vs. retention, or click vs. no click. In these cases, linear regression is no longer appropriate. In the next chapter, we introduce binary logistic regression, a modeling approach designed specifically for yes/no outcomes. You will learn how to estimate probabilities, interpret coefficients and marginal effects, and evaluate model performance in a way that is well-suited to common marketing decision problems.

Did the customer respond to a promotion? Did the customer churn? In these cases, the dependent variable takes on only two possible values. A standard linear regression model is not appropriate because it can produce predicted values below 0 or above 1 and does not model probabilities correctly. Binary logistic regression is designed specifically for situations where the outcome is binary. Rather than predicting the outcome directly, logistic regression models the probability that the outcome occurs. From a marketing perspective, this is powerful: instead of simply predicting “buy” or “not buy,” we can estimate how likely a customer is to buy and then use those probabilities for targeting and decision-making. 9.2 The Direct Marketing Data In this chapter, we use the directmktg dataset, which contains information on a direct marketing campaign. The dataset consists of 400 prospects and the following variables: userid: Unique identifier for each prospect age: Prospect age in years gender: Prospect gender (coded as provided) salary: Prospect salary in thousands of dollars buy: Purchase decision (“Yes” or “No”) The marketing objective is: Predict whether a prospect will purchase and estimate the probability of purchase. data(directmktg) 9.3 Splitting Data into Training and Test Samples To evaluate predictive performance, we split the data into training and test samples using splitsample() from the MKT4320BGSU package. Usage: splitsample(data, outcome = NULL, group = NULL, choice = NULL, alt = NULL, p = 0.75, seed = 4320) where: data is the data frame to split. outcome is the outcome variable used for stratification. Required when group is NULL. Optional when group is provided. For binary logistic regression, it is required. group is NOT USED FOR BINARY LOGISTIC choice is NOT USED FOR BINARY LOGISTIC alt is NOT USED FOR BINARY LOGISTIC p is the proportion of observations to place in the training set. Must be strictly between 0 and 1. Default is 0.75. seed is the random seed for reproducibility. Default is 4320. sp &lt;- splitsample(directmktg, outcome = &quot;buy&quot;) train &lt;- sp$train test &lt;- sp$test The training data are used to estimate the model. The test data are reserved for out-of-sample evaluation. 9.4 Estimating a Binary Logistic Regression Model We estimate a logistic regression model using glm() with family = \"binomial\".

However, these probabilities are also used in evaluating model fit through the classification matrix. NOTE: You do not have to create these probabilities manually like shown above. 9.7 Classification and Cutoff Values To classify prospects, we choose a probability cutoff (commonly 0.50). That is, a prospect/row is predicted to be “positive” if their predicted probability of the positive outcome is equal to 0.50 or greater. We use the logistic_classify() function from the MKT4320BGSU package to create classification matrices. Usage: classify_logistic(MOD, DATA, POSITIVE, CUTOFF = 0.5, DATA2 = NULL, LABEL1 = \"Sample 1\", LABEL2 = \"Sample 2\", digits = 3, ft = FALSE) where: MOD is a fitted binary logistic regression glm object (i.e., family = “binomial”). DATA a data frame for which the classification matrix should be produced. Usually train. POSITIVE is the level in the outcome variable representing the positive outcome. CUTOFF is the pobability cutoff for classification (default = 0.5). DATA2 is an optional second data frame (e.g., test/holdout sample). LABEL1 is the label for the first data set (default = “Sample 1”) LABEL2 is the label for the section data set, if provided (default = “Sample 2”) digits is the number of decimal places (default = 3) to show. ft is a logical operator to return a nicer looking flextable (default = FALSE). classify_logistic(MOD = mod, DATA = train, POSITIVE = &quot;Yes&quot;) Classification Matrix - Sample 1 (Cutoff = 0.50) Accuracy = 0.844 PCC = 0.540 No Yes Total No 176 30 206 Yes 17 78 95 Total 193 108 301 Selected Statistics (Positive Class): Sensitivity (TPR): 0.722 Specificity (TNR): 0.912 Precision (PPV): 0.821 We can also evaluate classification performance on the test sample and get the output in a “nicer” table. classify_logistic(MOD = mod, DATA = train, DATA2 = test, POSITIVE = &quot;Yes&quot;, LABEL1 = &quot;Training&quot;, LABEL2 = &quot;Test&quot;, ft=TRUE) a flextable object. col_keys: `Predicted`, `No`, `Yes`, `Total` header has 5 row(s) body has 7 row(s) original dataset sample: &#39;data.frame&#39;: 7 obs. of 4 variables: $ Predicted: chr &quot;No&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Total&quot; &quot;Selected Statistics (Positive Class):&quot; ... $ No : chr &quot;176&quot; &quot;17&quot; &quot;193&quot; &quot;&quot; ... $ Yes : chr &quot;30&quot; &quot;78&quot; &quot;108&quot; &quot;&quot; ... $ Total : chr &quot;206&quot; &quot;95&quot; &quot;301&quot; &quot;&quot; ... a flextable object. col_keys: `Predicted`, `No`, `Yes`, `Total` header has 5 row(s) body has 7 row(s) original dataset sample: &#39;data.frame&#39;: 7 obs. of 4 variables: $ Predicted: chr &quot;No&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Total&quot; &quot;Selected Statistics (Positive Class):&quot; ... $ No : chr &quot;58&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;64&quot; &quot;&quot; ... $ Yes : chr &quot;8&quot; &quot;27&quot; &quot;35&quot; &quot;&quot; ... $ Total : chr &quot;66&quot; &quot;33&quot; &quot;99&quot; &quot;&quot; ... 9.8 Choosing a Cutoff The default cutoff of 0.50 may not be optimal. The cutoff_logistic() function helps visualize tradeoffs between sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Usage: cutoff_logistic(MOD, DATA, POSITIVE, LABEL1 = \"Sample 1\", DATA2 = NULL, LABEL2 = \"Sample 2\") where: MOD is a fitted binary logistic regression model (glm with family = “binomial”). DATA a data frame for which the classification matrix should be produced. Usually train. POSITIVE is the level in the outcome variable representing the positive outcome. LABEL1 is the label for the first data set (default = “Sample 1”). DATA2 is an optional second data frame (e.g., test/holdout sample). LABEL2 is the label for the section data set, if provided (default = “Sample 2”). cut &lt;- cutoff_logistic(MOD = mod, DATA = train, DATA2 = test, POSITIVE = &quot;Yes&quot;, LABEL1 = &quot;Training&quot;, LABEL2 = &quot;Test&quot;) 9.9 ROC Curve and AUC The ROC curve evaluates model discrimination across all possible cutoffs. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) summarizes overall classification performance. To get the ROC curve, use the roc_logistic() function from the MKT4320BGSU package. Usage: roc_logistic(MOD, DATA, LABEL1 = \"Sample 1\", DATA2 = NULL, LABEL2 = \"Sample 2\") where: MOD is a fitted binary logistic regression model (glm with family = “binomial”). DATA a data frame for ROC computation. Usually train. LABEL1 is the label for the first data set (default = “Sample 1”). DATA2 is an optional second data frame (e.g., test/holdout sample) (default = NULL). LABEL2 is the label for the section data set, if provided (default = “Sample 2”). roc_logistic(MOD = mod, DATA = train, DATA2 = test, LABEL1 = &quot;Training&quot;,LABEL2 = &quot;Test&quot;) Setting levels: control = No, case = Yes Setting direction: controls &lt; cases Setting levels: control = No, case = Yes Setting direction: controls &lt; cases $sample1 $sample2 9.10 Gain and Lift Charts Gain and lift charts are especially useful for targeting decisions. These plots (and tables) show how much better the model performs relative to random targeting. To get the gain and lift charts, use the gainlift_logistic() function from the MKT4320BGSU package. Usage: gainlift_logistic(MOD, TRAIN, TEST, POSITIVE) where: MOD is a fitted binary logistic regression model (glm with family = “binomial”). TRAIN a data frame with the training data (usually train). TEST a data frame with the test/holdout data (usually test). POSITIVE is the level in the outcome variable representing the positive outcome. gl &lt;- gainlift_logistic(MOD = mod, TRAIN = train, TEST = test, POSITIVE = &quot;Yes&quot;) gl$gainplot gl$gaintable # A tibble: 20 × 3 `% Sample` Training Holdout &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.05 0.130 0.114 2 0.1 0.25 0.2 3 0.15 0.370 0.343 4 0.2 0.481 0.486 5 0.25 0.593 0.6 6 0.3 0.713 0.743 7 0.35 0.778 0.771 8 0.4 0.843 0.829 9 0.45 0.907 0.914 10 0.5 0.935 0.971 11 0.55 0.981 1 12 0.6 0.991 1 13 0.65 0.991 1 14 0.7 0.991 1 15 0.75 1 1 16 0.8 1 1 17 0.85 1 1 18 0.9 1 1 19 0.95 1 1 20 1 1 1 gl$liftplot gl$lifttable # A tibble: 20 × 3 `% Sample` Training Holdout &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.05 2.60 2.83 2 0.1 2.51 2.2 3 0.15 2.48 2.42 4 0.2 2.42 2.53 5 0.25 2.38 2.48 6 0.3 2.38 2.54 7 0.35 2.23 2.25 8 0.4 2.11 2.10 9 0.45 2.02 2.06 10 0.5 1.88 1.96 11 0.55 1.79 1.83 12 0.6 1.66 1.68 13 0.65 1.53 1.55 14 0.7 1.42 1.43 15 0.75 1.34 1.34 16 0.8 1.25 1.25 17 0.85 1.18 1.18 18 0.9 1.11 1.11 19 0.95 1.06 1.05 20 1 1 1 9.11 Margin Plots with easy_mp() Coefficients are difficult to interpret directly. Marginal effects plots help visualize how predictors influence purchase probability. As with linear regression (see Section 8.6), we use the easy_mp() function from the MKT4320BGSU package to help create the margin plots. mp_age &lt;- easy_mp(mod, focal = &quot;age&quot;) mp_age$plot We can also examine categorical predictors. mp_gender &lt;- easy_mp(mod, focal = &quot;gender&quot;) mp_gender$plot We can also examine interactions. mod_int &lt;- glm(buy ~ age * salary + gender, data = train, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) mp_gender &lt;- easy_mp(mod_int, focal = &quot;age&quot;, int=&quot;salary&quot;) mp_gender$plot 9.12 Putting It All Together Binary logistic regression provides a complete framework for: Predicting purchase probabilities Classifying prospects Evaluating models using multiple metrics Supporting targeting decisions No single metric tells the whole story. Marketing analysts must choose evaluation tools that align with business objectives. 9.13 What’s Next In the next chapter, we shift from prediction to segmentation. We will use cluster analysis to: Identify distinct customer segments based on observed attributes Understand how customers naturally group together Support positioning, targeting, and strategy development Translate data-driven segments into actionable marketing insights Where logistic regression answers questions like “Who is likely to buy?”, cluster analysis addresses questions such as: What types of customers do we have? How are customers meaningfully different from one another? How many segments make sense from a managerial perspective? The next chapter introduces several clustering approaches, discusses how to choose the number of clusters, and emphasizes interpretation and managerial usefulness over purely technical solutions.

Unlike regression or classification models, cluster analysis is an unsupervised learning technique: there is no dependent variable. Instead, the objective is to identify groups of customers who are similar to one another and meaningfully different from customers in other groups. In marketing contexts, cluster analysis is commonly used to: Identify distinct customer segments Support targeting and positioning decisions Inform product design and messaging strategy Provide structure for downstream analysis and managerial reporting Because cluster analysis does not optimize a predictive objective, interpretation and managerial judgment play a central role in determining whether a solution is useful. 10.2 The ffseg Dataset This chapter uses the ffseg dataset, which contains survey responses related to fast-food consumption behaviors, attitudes, and demographics. Each row represents an individual consumer. The dataset includes: Numeric attitudinal and behavioral variables suitable for segmentation Demographic and categorical variables used for describing clusters after they are formed 10.3 Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering 10.3.1 Conceptual Overview Hierarchical agglomerative clustering builds clusters from the bottom up. Each observation starts as its own cluster, and clusters are successively merged based on similarity until all observations belong to a single cluster. Key features of hierarchical clustering include: No need to specify the number of clusters in advance A dendrogram that visualizes the clustering process Strong transparency for exploratory segmentation 10.3.2 Initial Hierarchical Clustering Fit We begin by fitting a hierarchical clustering model using selected segmentation variables from the ffseg dataset. While base R can do this for us in a number of steps, we can more easily do the initial fit using the easy_hc_fit() function from the MKT4320BGSU package. Usage: easy_hc_fit(data, vars, dist = c(\"euc\", \"euc2\", \"max\", \"abs\", \"bin\"), method = c(\"ward\", \"single\", \"complete\", \"average\"), k_range = 1:10, standardize = TRUE, show_dend = TRUE, dend_max_n = 300) where: data is a data frame containing the full dataset. vars is a character vector of numeric segmentation variable names. dist is a distance measure to use. One of: “euc”, “euc2”, “max”, “abs”, “bin”. method is a linkage method to use. One of: “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”. k_range is an integer vector of cluster solutions to evaluate (default 1:10; allowed 1–20). standardize is logical; if TRUE (default), standardizes segmentation variables prior to clustering. show_dend is logical; if TRUE (default), plots a dendrogram (skipped if n &gt; dend_max_n). dend_max_n is an integer for the maximum sample size for drawing a dendrogram (default 300). When using the easy_hc_fit() function, the results should be saved to an object. The $stop diagnostics table saved in the object provides the necessary results to help decide on a (potential) final solution. The diagnostics table summarizes multiple stopping rules and balance checks across different values of \\(k\\). No single statistic should be used in isolation when choosing the number of clusters. You can also view the $size_prop table to see the cluster sizes for all potential solutions. hc_vars &lt;- c(&quot;quality&quot;, &quot;price&quot;, &quot;healthy&quot;, &quot;variety&quot;,

consider: Statistical indicators such as the Gap statistic Whether clusters are reasonably balanced in size Whether the resulting segments are interpretable and actionable Extremely small clusters or one dominant cluster are often warning signs in marketing segmentation. 10.3.4 Final Hierarchical Clustering Solution Once a reasonable number of clusters has been selected, we finalize the hierarchical clustering solution and attach cluster membership back to the full dataset using the easy_hc_final() function from the MKT4320BGSU package. Usage: easy_hc_final(fit, data, k, cluster_col = \"cluster\", conf_level = 0.95, auto_print = TRUE) where: fit is the object returned by easy_hc_fit. data is the original full dataset used to create fit. k is an integer representing the number of clusters to extract. cluster_col is the name of the cluster column to append to data (default “cluster”). Must not already exist in data. conf_level confidence level for CI error bars when plotting (default 0.95). auto_print is logical; if TRUE (default), prints props and profile and displays the plot (if available). Using the example from above with a 3-cluster solution, the cluster profile table reports mean values of the segmentation variables for each cluster. These means should be interpreted in relative terms across clusters. The cluster plot visualizes those means. hc_final &lt;- easy_hc_final(fit = hc_fit, data = ffseg, k = 3, cluster_col = &quot;hc_cluster&quot;, auto_print = FALSE) hc_final$props Cluster N Prop 1 1 297 0.3949468 2 2 286 0.3803191 3 3 169 0.2247340 hc_final$profile Cluster quality price healthy variety speed 1 1 4.737374 4.050505 3.996633 3.905724 3.936027 2 2 3.723776 4.520979 2.339161 2.979021 3.674825 3 3 3.905325 3.047337 2.568047 2.952663 3.112426 hc_final$plot 10.4 Describing and Labeling Hierarchical Clusters Segmentation variables alone rarely provide enough context to understand who the clusters represent. Additional variables are used to describe and label the clusters. For both hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering (see below), use the easy_cluster_decribe() function from the MKT4320BGSU package to automate this process. Usage: easy_cluster_describe(data, cluster_col = \"cluster\", vars = NULL, alpha = 0.05,drop_missing = TRUE, auto_print = TRUE) where: data is the data frame containing the cluster membership column and variables to describe that was saved to the easy_hc_final object; should be objectname$data. cluster_col is a character string naming the cluster membership column in data (default = “cluster”). vars is an optional character vector of variables to describe. If NULL (default), all columns except cluster_col are used. alpha is the significance level for hypothesis tests (default = 0.05). drop_missing is logical; if TRUE (default), rows with missing cluster membership are dropped prior to analysis. auto_print is logical; if TRUE (default), prints summaries to the console. Using the results from above, the output highlights which variables significantly differentiate clusters and provides detailed summaries only where differences are statistically meaningful. Note that if we do not indicate which vars we want to use, the amount of results is usually very large. describe_vars &lt;- c(&quot;usertype&quot;, &quot;spend&quot;, &quot;hours&quot;, &quot;eatin&quot;, &quot;mealplan&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;) easy_cluster_describe(data = hc_final$data, cluster_col = &quot;hc_cluster&quot;, vars=describe_vars) Continuous variables (p-values): Variable Test p_value Significant hours ANOVA 0.0000 TRUE eatin ANOVA 0.0204 TRUE Continuous variables (cluster summaries of significant variables): --- hours --- Cluster N Mean SD 1 297 3.7104 0.9428 2 286 3.5420 1.0139 3 169 3.0651 1.0698 Significant differences: 1 &gt; 3, 2 &gt; 3 --- eatin --- Cluster N Mean SD 1 297 3.9865 2.0000 2 286 4.4406 1.9775 3 169 4.1598 1.9035 Significant differences: 2 &gt; 1 Categorical variables (overall tests): Variable Test p_value Significant usertype Chi-square 0.0550 FALSE spend Chi-square 0.0035 TRUE mealplan Chi-square 0.8882 FALSE gender Chi-square 0.0000 TRUE Categorical variables (details for significant variables): --- spend --- Cross-tab (column %; clusters are columns): 1 2 3 $10 or more 25.2525 17.4825 26.6272 $5 to $9 61.9529 63.6364 65.6805 Less than $5 12.7946 18.8811 7.6923 Post-hoc (Holm-adjusted p-values): 1:2 1:3 2:3 $10 or more:$5 to $9 0.3758 1.00 0.5700 $10 or more:Less than $5 0.0620 0.57 0.0023 $5 to $9:Less than $5 0.5700 0.57 0.0335 --- gender --- Cross-tab (column %; clusters are columns): 1 2 3 Female 81.8182 67.8322 59.1716 Male 18.1818 32.1678 40.8284 Post-hoc (Holm-adjusted p-values): 1:2 1:3 2:3 Female:Male 2e-04 0 0.0681 10.5 K-Means Clustering 10.5.1 Conceptual Overview k-means clustering is a partition-based method that assigns observations to a fixed number of clusters by minimizing within-cluster variation. Unlike hierarchical clustering, k-means requires the analyst to specify the number of clusters in advance. k-means is often preferred when: Working with larger datasets Refining a solution suggested by hierarchical clustering Stability and computational efficiency are priorities The process used for k-means clustering follows the process used above in hierarchical agglomerative clustering. That is, we first initially fit a number of potential solutions, and then we anlayze a final solution. 10.5.2 Initial K-Means Clustering Fit We first fit k-means clustering solutions across a range of cluster counts using the easy_km_fit() function from the MKT4320BGSU package. Usage: easy_km_fit(data, vars, k_range = 1:10, standardize = TRUE, nstart = 25, iter.max = 100, B = 20, seed = 4320) where: data is a data frame containing the full dataset. vars is a character vector of numeric variable names used for clustering. k_range is an integer vector of cluster counts to evaluate (default = 1:10; allowed values 1–20). standardize is logical; if TRUE (default), clustering variables are standardized before fitting k-means. nstart is an integer; number of random starts for each k-means solution (default = 25). iter.max is an integer; maximum number of iterations allowed for each k-means run (default = 100). B is an integer; number of Monte Carlo bootstrap samples used to compute the Gap statistic (default = 20). seed is an integer; random seed for reproducible results (default = 4320). We now fit the same variables we used above in hierarchical clustering. As before, the results should be saved to an object. The $diag diagnostics table saved in the object provides the necessary results to help decide on a (potential) final solution. The diagnostics table summarizes multiple stopping rules and balance checks across different values of \\(k\\). No single statistic should be used in isolation when choosing the number of clusters. You can also view the $size_prop table to see the cluster sizes for all potential solutions. km_vars &lt;- c(&quot;quality&quot;, &quot;price&quot;, &quot;healthy&quot;, &quot;variety&quot;,

finalize the k-means solution using the easy_km_final() function from the MKT4320BGSU package. Usage: easy_km_final(fit, data, k, cluster_col = \"cluster\", conf_level = 0.95, auto_print = TRUE) where: fit is an object returned by easy_km_fit(). data is the original full dataset used in easy_km_fit(). k is an integer; number of clusters to extract. cluster_col is a character string; name of the cluster column to append to data (default = “cluster”). conf_level is numeric; confidence level for CI error bars (default = 0.95). auto_print is logical; if TRUE (default), prints selected outputs and displays the plot when the function is run. Using the example from above with a 3-cluster solution, the cluster profile table reports mean values of the segmentation variables for each cluster. These means should be interpreted in relative terms across clusters. The cluster plot visualizes those means. km_final &lt;- easy_km_final(fit = km_fit, data = ffseg, k = 3, cluster_col = &quot;km_cluster&quot;, auto_print = FALSE) km_final$props Cluster N Prop 1 1 238 0.3164894 2 2 308 0.4095745 3 3 206 0.2739362 km_final$plot km_final$profile Cluster quality price healthy variety speed 1 1 3.483193 4.361345 2.117647 2.907563 3.680672 2 2 4.714286 4.399351 3.762987 4.022727 4.000000 3 3 4.131068 3.000000 3.043689 2.815534 3.097087 10.6 Describing and Labeling k-Means Clusters As with hierarchical clustering, segmentation variables alone rarely provide enough context to understand who the clusters represent. Additional variables are used to describe and label the clusters. As with hierarchical clustering, use the easy_cluster_decribe() function from the MKT4320BGSU package to automate this process. See Section 10.4 10.7 Comparing Clustering Approaches Hierarchical and k-means clustering often produce similar but not identical segmentation results. Differences between solutions can be informative and may reveal alternative ways to think about the market. In practice, analysts often: Use hierarchical clustering to explore the structure of the data Use k-means clustering to refine and stabilize the final solution 10.8 Chapter Summary In this chapter, we: Introduced cluster analysis as a tool for marketing segmentation Applied hierarchical and k-means clustering to the ffseg dataset Used diagnostics to guide the choice of the number of clusters Described and interpreted clusters in a marketing context 10.9 What’s Next In the next chapter, we shift from grouping customers to summarizing and visualizing variables. Specifically, we will introduce Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and then extend it to PCA perceptual maps. PCA is a dimensionality-reduction technique that helps simplify complex datasets by transforming many correlated variables into a smaller set of components that capture the most important patterns in the data. You will learn how PCA can be used to: Reduce a large set of variables into a smaller number of interpretable dimensions Identify underlying structures in consumer perceptions and evaluations Prepare data for visualization and communication We will then use these components to create perceptual maps, which are widely used in marketing to: Visualize brand or product positions Understand competitive structure Support positioning and differentiation decisions "],["pca-and-perceptual-maps.html", "Chapter 11 PCA and Perceptual Maps 11.1 Introduction: Why PCA Matters in Marketing Analytics 11.2 The greekbrands Dataset 11.3 Preparing for PCA in a Marketing Context 11.4 PCA Modeling 11.5 From PCA to Perceptual Maps 11.6 Attribute-Based Perceptual Maps Using PCA 11.7 Managerial Interpretation and Strategic Insights 11.8 Chapter Summary 11.9 What’s Next", " Chapter 11 PCA and Perceptual Maps 11.1 Introduction: Why PCA Matters in Marketing Analytics Marketing datasets often contain many related variables that describe how consumers perceive brands, products, or services. When these attributes are highly correlated, interpretation becomes difficult and redundancy increases. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a dimension-reduction technique that helps uncover the underlying structure in such data. In marketing analytics, PCA is commonly used to: Summarize brand image and positioning data Reduce large attribute batteries into interpretable dimensions Serve as the foundation for perceptual maps In this chapter, we focus on applying PCA for interpretation and insight, not mathematical derivation. We will: Fit a PCA model and evaluate diagnostics Choose an appropriate number of components Interpret component loadings Use PCA results to construct perceptual maps As a high-level overview, PCA transforms a set of correlated variables into a smaller set of new variables called principal components. Each component is a weighted combination of the original variables. Key ideas: Components are ordered by how much variance they explain The first component explains the most variance, the second explains the most remaining variance, and so on Components are uncorrelated with one another From a marketing perspective, PCA helps answer: “What are the main dimensions consumers use to differentiate brands?” 11.2 The greekbrands Dataset This chapter uses the greekbrands dataset, which contains simulated attribute ratings and brand preference data for ten fictional technology brands. Each observation corresponds to a respondent-brand evaluation. The dataset includes: A brand identifier Multiple numeric attribute ratings describing brand perceptions This type of brand image data is well suited for PCA because many of the attributes tend to be correlated and may reflect a smaller number of latent dimensions. 11.3 Preparing for PCA in a Marketing Context Before fitting a PCA model, it is important to: Use only numeric perceptual attributes Exclude identifiers (e.g., brand names, respondent IDs) Consider whether PCA should be run at the individual or brand level For perceptual mapping, brand-level aggregation is typically preferred so that brands (not respondents) appear as points in the map. 11.4 PCA Modeling 11.4.1 Fitting an Initial PCA Model We begin with an initial PCA fit to evaluate how many components should be retained. This step focuses on diagnostics rather than interpretation. Although PCA is not difficult in base R using the prcomp() function, we’ll use the easy_pca_fit() function from the MKT4320BGSU to automate the process for both fitting and a separate function for the final model. Usage: easy_pca_fit(data, vars, group = NULL, ft = TRUE) where: data is a data frame containing the full dataset. vars is a character vector of variable names to use in PCA (required). All variables must be numeric. group is an optional character sting of a single variable name to aggregate by before PCA. ft is logical; if TRUE, return $table as a flextable (default = TRUE). In the example below, we do not use the group option. attr_vars &lt;- c(&quot;perform&quot;, &quot;leader&quot;, &quot;fun&quot;, &quot;serious&quot;, &quot;bargain&quot;, &quot;value&quot;) pca_fit

pca_fit$plot The eigenvalue table and scree plot summarize how much variance each component explains. Important columns in the eigenvalue table include: Eigenvalue: total variance explained by each component Proportion: share of total variance explained Cumulative: cumulative proportion of variance explained Common decision rules: Retain components with eigenvalues greater than 1 Look for an “elbow” where additional components add little explanatory power Aim for a solution that balances parsimony and interpretability There is no single correct answer. Component retention should be guided by marketing judgment as well as statistics. 11.4.2 Final PCA Solution After deciding how many components to retain, we refit the PCA model and examine the loadings using the easy_pca_final() function from the MKT4320BGSU package.

the varimax-rotated loadings because they are easier to interpret. A loading represents the relationship between an original attribute and a component: Larger absolute values indicate stronger relationships Attributes with high loadings on the same component tend to reflect a common underlying dimension When interpreting loadings: Look for patterns across attributes Identify which attributes define each component Assign descriptive, managerially meaningful names to components For example: A component with high loadings on perform, leader, and serious might be labeled Performance A component with high loadings on bargain and value might be labeled Value Orientation 11.5 From PCA to Perceptual Maps PCA components can be used as axes in perceptual maps. Each brand’s position on a component reflects how strongly it scores on that underlying dimension. Perceptual maps translate statistical results into a visual format that is easy to communicate to managers and decision-makers. 11.6 Attribute-Based Perceptual Maps Using PCA 11.6.1 Creating PCA-Based Maps We now use the retained PCA solution to create perceptual maps. We use the easy_pca_maps() function from the MKT4320BGSU package to automate the process. Usage: easy_pca_maps(data, vars, group, comp, pref = NULL, rotate = TRUE, arrow_scale = 0.75,label_pad = 0.04) where: data is a data frame containing individual-level observations. vars is a character vector of numeric attribute variable names used in PCA. group is a single string specifying the grouping variable (e.g., brand or product name). comp is an integer specifying the number of components to retain (must be \\(≥2\\)). pref is an optional single string specifying a numeric preference variable name to produce a joint space map with a preference vector (if data is available) rotate is logical; if TRUE (default), apply varimax rotation to the retained component space before creating perceptual maps. arrow_scale is numeric in (0, 1]; scales arrow lengths relative to the object range (default = 0.75). label_pad is numeric; distance (as a proportion of the axis range) used to push attribute arrow labels beyond arrow tips (default = 0.04) for easier viewing of the map. We’ll use the same variables as before, but add in the required group and an optional pref to create a joint space map. pca_maps &lt;- easy_pca_maps(data = greekbrands, vars = attr_vars, group = &quot;brand&quot;, pref = &quot;pref&quot;, comp = 2) pca_maps$plots $Comp_1_vs_Comp_2 The map displays: Brands as points Attribute vectors showing how attributes align with the components Key interpretation guidelines: Brands close together are perceived similarly Brands far apart are perceived differently Attribute vectors indicate the direction of increasing attribute values Brands in the direction of an attribute vector score higher on that attribute Attribute vectors more parallel with the preference vector (if available) a stronger drivers of preference Distances are relative and should be interpreted qualitatively rather than precisely. 11.7 Managerial Interpretation and Strategic Insights PCA-based perceptual maps can help managers: Identify direct competitors Detect market clusters and white space Evaluate whether a brand’s positioning matches strategic intent These insights can inform: Positioning statements Advertising and messaging strategy Product reformulation decisions Common Pitfalls and Best Practices Do not over-interpret small loadings Avoid retaining too many components Remember that PCA alone reflects perceptions, not preferences Always explain components in clear, non-technical language 11.8 Chapter Summary In this chapter, we: Used PCA to reduce and interpret brand perception data Applied diagnostics to choose the number of components Interpreted rotated component loadings Created perceptual maps to visualize brand positioning PCA is a powerful bridge between data analysis and strategic insight in marketing analytics. 11.9 What’s Next In the next chapter, we shift from describing perceptions to testing causal impact.Specifically, we will study A/B testing and uplift modeling, which are tools used to answer questions such as: Does a new message, offer, or design actually change behavior? How large is the effect of a treatment compared to a control? Are some customers more responsive to an intervention than others? Where PCA and perceptual maps help us understand how consumers see brands, A/B testing helps us evaluate what actions work, and uplift modeling helps us determine for whom they work best. These methods are central to modern data-driven marketing in areas such as digital advertising, pricing experiments, promotions, and personalization.

Whether testing email subject lines, promotional offers, website layouts, or pricing messages, marketers frequently rely on randomized experiments to measure causal effects. In this chapter, we begin with average treatment effects (ATEs), which is the traditional goal of A/B testing,and then move beyond averages to uplift modeling, which focuses on identifying who is most likely to be influenced by a marketing intervention. Throughout the chapter, we use data from an email marketing experiment contained in the email.camp.w dataset. 12.2 The Email Campaign Experiment The dataset email.camp.w comes from a randomized email campaign experiment. Customers were randomly assigned to receive either: a promotional email (treatment group), or no promotional email (control group). The primary outcome of interest is whether the customer responded (e.g., clicked or converted). In addition, the dataset contains several customer characteristics (covariates) such as demographics and prior behavior. Because treatment assignment was randomized, differences in outcomes between the two groups can be interpreted causally. 12.3 Checking the Randomization Assumption 12.3.1 Why Balance Checks Matter Randomization ensures that treatment and control groups are similar on average. However, especially in applied settings, it is good practice to verify that observable covariates are balanced across groups. Large imbalances may signal problems such as implementation errors or data issues. 12.3.2 Randomization Check Using rand_check() The rand_check() function from the MKT4320BGSU package compares the distribution of selected covariates across treatment groups and automatically applies appropriate statistical tests. Usage: rand_check(data, treatment, covariates, ft = TRUE, digits = 3) where: data is a data frame containing the treatment indicator and covariates. treatment is a character string giving the name of the treatment variable. Must identify two or more groups. covariates is a character vector of covariate names to include in the randomization check. ft is logical; if TRUE (default), return results as a flextable. If FALSE, return a data frame. digits is an integer; number of decimal places to display in the output (default = 3). An example is provided below. When reviewing the output, focus on: Scaled mean differences: values close to zero indicate good balance. p-values: large p-values suggest no systematic differences. Well-balanced covariates support the validity of the experiment. rand_check(data = email.camp.w, treatment = &quot;promotion&quot;, covariates = c(&quot;recency&quot;, &quot;history&quot;, &quot;womens&quot;, &quot;zip&quot;), ft = TRUE) .cl-9f0f3000{}.cl-9f089e16{font-family:'Arial';font-size:11pt;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);background-color:transparent;}.cl-9f089e20{font-family:'Arial';font-size:11pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);background-color:transparent;}.cl-9f0b60b0{margin:0;text-align:center;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);padding-bottom:5pt;padding-top:5pt;padding-left:5pt;padding-right:5pt;line-height: 1;background-color:transparent;}.cl-9f0b60ba{margin:0;text-align:left;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);padding-bottom:1pt;padding-top:1pt;padding-left:5pt;padding-right:5pt;line-height: 1;background-color:transparent;}.cl-9f0b60c4{margin:0;text-align:right;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);padding-bottom:1pt;padding-top:1pt;padding-left:5pt;padding-right:5pt;line-height: 1;background-color:transparent;}.cl-9f0b7b4a{width:0.75in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: bottom;border-bottom: 1.5pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-top: 1.5pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-9f0b7b54{width:0.75in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-9f0b7b55{width:0.75in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-9f0b7b68{width:0.75in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 1.5pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-9f0b7b69{width:0.75in;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 1.5pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}VariableMeanSDScaled Mean Differencep-valueTreatmentControlrecency5.8105.7253.5040.0240.227history245.995242.539253.3840.0140.495womens0.5450.5390.4980.0110.574zip:Rural0.1430.1480.353-0.0140.395zip:Surburban0.4590.4450.4980.027zip:Urban0.3980.4060.490-0.017 12.4 Estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) 12.4.1 What Is the ATE? The average treatment effect measures the average impact of the promotion across all customers. In an email campaign, this answers the question: Did sending the promotion increase response rates overall? 12.4.2 ATE via Regression For binary outcomes, a linear regression with a treatment indicator is equivalent to a difference-in-means estimator. When the outcome is binary, this is known as a linear probability model (LPM). 12.4.3 Using easy_ab_ate() We estimate the ATE using a regression model that includes the treatment indicator and optionally adjusts for covariates by using the easy_ab_ate() function from the MKT4320BGSU package. Usage: easy_ab_ate(model, treatment, ft = TRUE) where: model is a fitted linear regression model of class lm. This model should include the treatment variable and (optionally) covariates. treatment is a character string with the name of the treatment variable (in quotes). ft is logical; if TRUE (default) return a flextable. If FALSE, print full regression results to the console. Note that to use this function, you must first create a linear regression model using the lm() function. The model should have a response variable as the dependent variable, the treatment variable as an independent variable, and any additional covariates as additional independent variables. The results should be saved to an object. For example: object &lt;- lm(response ~ treatment + cov_1 + cov_2 + ... + cov_k, data = data) m_ab_visit &lt;- lm(visit ~ promotion + recency + history + womens + zip, data = email.camp.w) easy_ab_ate(model = m_ab_visit, treatment = &quot;promotion&quot;, ft = TRUE)

The table compares two models: Without covariates: a pure A/B comparison. With covariates: a regression-adjusted estimate. The treatment coefficient represents the average change in response probability caused by the promotion in isolation (in the without covariates column) or when controlling for other variables (in the with covariates column). 12.4.4 Why Average Effects Are Not Enough While the ATE is useful, it hides important heterogeneity: Some customers may respond very positively. Others may be unaffected or even respond negatively. From a managerial perspective, sending promotions to everyone may be inefficient or costly. This motivates uplift modeling, which focuses on targeting customers who are most likely to be influenced. 12.5 Introduction to Uplift Modeling 12.5.1 What Is Uplift? Uplift measures the incremental effect of treatment on an individual. That is, how much more likely is this customer to respond because they received the promotion? This differs from standard prediction, which focuses on response likelihood regardless of treatment. 12.5.2 Two-Model (Indirect) Approach The two-model approach estimates: one model estimated on treated customers, and one model estimated on control customers. The difference between their predicted outcomes for a given customer is the estimated uplift. 12.6 Estimating Uplift with easy_uplift() 12.6.1 Model Specification The outcome variable can be either continuous, like amount spent (outcome) after a promotion (treatment), or it can be binary, like if they visited or not (outcome) after a promotion (treatment). To perform a uplift modeling using regression, we will use the easy_uplift() function from the MKT4320BGSU package. This function performs uplift modeling based on either logistic regression (for binary outcomes) or linear regression (for continuous outcomes). The function uses the two-model, indirect modeling approach. Usage: easy_uplift(model, treatment, newdata = NULL, bins = 10, aspect_ratio = NULL) where: model is a fitted regression model of class glm (binary logit) or lm. treatment is a character string giving the name of the treatment variable. The variable must have exactly two levels and be coded as (0/1), logical, or (“Yes”, “No”). newdata is an optional data frame on which to compute uplift (e.g., holdout or test data). If NULL, uplift is computed on the model data. bins is an integer; number of groups used for the uplift tables and plots. Must be between 5 and 20. Default is 10. aspect_ratio is an optional numeric aspect ratio applied to all plots. Default is NULL. In order to use the function, we must first create our base model: The base model is usually a model with no interactions included, along with the treatment variable. But if known interactions are to be used, the base model can include the interactions also. The base model must contain the treatment variable. Base model examples: email_visit &lt;- glm(visit ~ promotion + recency + history + zip + womens, data=email.camp.w, family=&quot;binomial&quot;) email_spend &lt;- lm(spend ~ promotion + recency + history + zip + womens, data=email.camp.w) Once the base model is created, we are aready to use the easy_uplift() function: visit_uplift &lt;- easy_uplift(model = email_visit, treatment = &quot;promotion&quot;) visit_uplift$plots $qini $uplift $c.gain spend_uplift &lt;- easy_uplift(model = email_spend, treatment = &quot;promotion&quot;) spend_uplift$plots $qini $uplift $c.gain 12.6.2 Interpreting Core Outputs The uplift object includes: predicted individual-level lift appended to original data ($all), uplift table by percentile group ($group), diagnostic plots, including: uplift by group ($plots$uplift), cumulative gain ($plots$c.gain), Qini curve ($plots$qini). Customers in the top-ranked groups should exhibit the largest incremental gains from treatment. 12.7 Diagnosing Uplift with Lift Plots 12.7.1 Why Lift Diagnostics Matter Lift diagnostics help explain why uplift varies across customers and which covariates drive heterogeneity. 12.7.2 Using easy_liftplots() We use the easy_liftplots() function from the MKT4320BGSU package to easily create lift plots. Usage: easy_liftplots(x, vars = \"all\", pairs = NULL, ar = NULL, ci = 0.95, bins = 30, numeric_bins = 5, by_numeric_bins = 3, grid = TRUE, top = NULL, ft = TRUE) where: x is an object returned by easy_uplift() (must include x\\(all and x\\)covariates or x\\(spec\\)covariates). vars is a character vector of covariate names to plot. Default is “all” (uses x\\(covariates / x\\)spec$covariates). pairs is an optional list of length-2 character vectors specifying interaction-style plots to create, e.g., list(c(“recency”,“zip”), c(“gender”,“income”)). ar is an optional aspect ratio passed to theme(aspect.ratio = ar). Default is NULL. ci affects the error-bar style. Use 0 for \\(\\pm 1\\) SD error bars, or one of c(0.90, 0.95, 0.975, 0.99) for normal-approximation confidence intervals. Default is 0.95. bins is an integer; number of bins for the histogram. Default is 30. numeric_bins is an integer; number of quantile bins for numeric covariates. Default is 5. by_numeric_bins is an integer; number of quantile bins to use for the second variable in a pair when it is numeric. Default is 3. grid is logical; if TRUE, also return paginated cowplot grids of plots. Default is TRUE. top is an optional integer. If provided, only the top top covariates (by score_wmae) are included in plots_main/pages_main. Rankings are still computed for all covariates. ft is logical; if TRUE (default), return ranking tables as flextable objects. A histogram is always produced, which shows the distribution of predicted uplift across customers. It is saved as $hist. lift_out &lt;- easy_liftplots(visit_uplift, vars = &quot;all&quot;, ci = 0.99) lift_out$hist The main lift plots are saved in $plots_main. Lift-by-covariate plots display how average uplift varies across customer segments. lift_out$plots_main $recency $history $zip $womens The pairs option is exteremely valuable when known interactions are includedin the model. The option can also be useful to help identify if an interaction may be warranted. If pairs is provided, the plots are saved in plots_pairs. lift_out_pairs &lt;- easy_liftplots(visit_uplift, vars = &quot;all&quot;, pairs = list(c(&quot;recency&quot;,&quot;zip&quot;), c(&quot;history&quot;,&quot;womens&quot;)), ci = 0.99) lift_out_pairs$plots_pairs $`recency × zip` $`history × womens` 12.8 From Analysis to Action Uplift modeling enables smarter targeting strategies: Send promotions only to customers with positive uplift. Prioritize customers in the highest uplift deciles. Avoid over-targeting customers unlikely to respond. These strategies can improve campaign profitability and customer experience. 12.9 Summary In this chapter, you learned how to: validate randomization in A/B tests, estimate average treatment effects, move beyond averages using uplift modeling, interpret uplift diagnostics for targeting decisions. A/B testing answers whether a campaign works. Uplift modeling answers for whom it works. 12.10 What’s Next In many real-world marketing problems, managers face a different challenge: customers are not choosing between respond and not respond, but among multiple competing alternatives. Examples include: Which brand a customer purchases Which product variant is selected Which service tier is chosen In the next chapter, we introduce standard multinomial logistic regression, a workhorse model for analyzing and predicting choice among more than two options. You will learn how to: Model customer choice across multiple alternatives Interpret coefficients and predicted choice probabilities Evaluate model fit and classification performance Use multinomial logit models for applied marketing decisions This next step shifts our focus from experimental treatment effects to choice modeling, setting the foundation for more advanced models of consumer decision-making used throughout marketing analytics and research.

Consumers may choose among competing brands, subscription plans, service providers, or product variants. When the outcome variable has more than two unordered categories, linear regression and binary logistic regression are no longer appropriate. The standard multinomial logit (MNL) model is the most common baseline model for analyzing and predicting such outcomes. In marketing analytics, it is widely used for brand choice, product selection, and competitive response analysis. The focus of this chapter is on applied interpretation rather than mathematical derivation. 13.2 The bfast Dataset In this chapter, we use the bfast dataset, which contains data on breakfast food preferences. Each observation represents a consumer choice occasion in which one type of food was selected from a competitive set. The outcome variable records the chosen type, while predictor variables capture marketing mix and consumer characteristics that may influence choice. Our core marketing question is: Which factors increase or decrease the probability that a consumer chooses a particular fast-food brand? 13.3 Training and Test Samples To evaluate predictive performance, we split the data into training and test samples. As with binary logistic regression, we use the splitsample() function from the MKT4320BGSU package. This function creates reproducible partitions and supports stratification on the outcome variable. Usage: splitsample(data, outcome = NULL, group = NULL, choice = NULL, alt = NULL, p = 0.75, seed = 4320) where: data is the data frame to split. outcome is the outcome variable in quotes used for stratification. Required when group is NULL. Optional when group is provided. For standard MNL, it is required. group is NOT USED FOR STANDARD MNL choice is NOT USED FOR STANDARD MNL alt is NOT USED FOR STANDARD MNL p is the proportion of observations to place in the training set. Must be strictly between 0 and 1. Default is 0.75. seed is the random seed for reproducibility. Default is 4320. Below, we create are training and test samples. We also check the outcome variable in the two samples to ensure they are similar proportions in each. sp &lt;- splitsample(data = bfast, outcome = &quot;bfast&quot;) train &lt;- sp$train test &lt;- sp$test proportions(table(train$bfast)) Cereal Bar Oatmeal 0.3851964 0.2628399 0.3519637 proportions(table(test$bfast)) Cereal Bar Oatmeal 0.3853211 0.2614679 0.3532110 13.4 Estimating a Standard Multinomial Logit Model We estimate the standard multinomial logit model using nnet::multinom(). It is important to include model = TRUE so that model diagnostics and classification results can be computed later. Using the summary() function in base R will provide the raw coefficients from the model. The estimated coefficients describe how each predictor affects the relative log-odds of choosing one product versus the reference product. library(nnet) mnl_fit &lt;- multinom(bfast ~ gender + marital + lifestyle + age, model = TRUE, data=train) # weights: 18 (10 variable) initial value 727.281335 iter 10 value 579.014122 final value 574.997631 converged summary(mnl_fit) Call: multinom(formula = bfast ~ gender + marital + lifestyle + age, data = train, model = TRUE) Coefficients: (Intercept) genderMale maritalUnmarried lifestyleInactive age Bar 0.8832457 -0.21298963 0.6126977 -0.7865772 -0.02532866 Oatmeal -4.4920408 -0.02262325 -0.3897362 0.3187473 0.07996475 Std.

We use eval_std_mnl() from the MKT4320BGSU package to compute model-fit statistics and diagnostics. Usage: eval_std_mnl(OBJ, exp = FALSE, digits = 4, ft = FALSE, newdata = NULL, label_model = \"Model data\", label_newdata = \"New data\", class_digits = 3) where: model is a fitted multinom model. exp is logical; if TRUE, return relative risk ratios (exp(beta)). If FALSE, return log-odds coefficients (default = FALSE). digits is an integer; number of decimals used to round coefficient and model-fit results (default = 4). ft is logical; if TRUE, return coefficient and classification tables as flextable objects (default = FALSE). newdata is an optional data frame for an additional classification matrix (e.g., a holdout or test set). If NULL, only the model-data classification is produced. label_model is a character string; label for the model-data classification output (default = “Model data”). label_newdata is a character string; label for the newdata classification output (default = “New data”). class_digits is an integer; number of decimals used to round classification statistics (default = 3). Key outputs include: A likelihood-ratio test comparing the fitted model to an intercept-only model McFadden’s pseudo R-squared Classification accuracy and diagnostics In applied marketing contexts, even modest pseudo R-squared values can indicate meaningful improvements over random choice. mnl_eval &lt;- eval_std_mnl(model = mnl_fit, newdata = test, ft = TRUE) mnl_eval

Interpreting Coefficients Coefficient estimates in a standard MNL model are interpreted relative to the reference brand. A positive coefficient means that higher values of the predictor increase the likelihood of choosing that brand relative to the baseline. To aid interpretation, coefficients can also be expressed as relative risk ratios (RRRs). RRRs greater than 1 indicate increased relative likelihood, while values below 1 indicate decreased likelihood. These interpretations are often more intuitive for managerial audiences. mnl_eval_rrr &lt;- eval_std_mnl(model = mnl_fit, exp = TRUE, newdata = test, ft=TRUE) mnl_eval_rrr$coef_table

13.5.2 Classification Performance Beyond fit statistics, classification results help assess how well the model predicts observed choices. The output includes: Overall accuracy Proportional Chance Criterion (PCC) Product-specific sensitivity, specificity, and precision These metrics help identify which brands are easier or harder to predict based on observed covariates. 13.5.3 Holdout Sample Evaluation Evaluating the model on a test sample provides insight into how well it generalizes to new data. Large discrepancies between training and test performance may indicate overfitting. In practice, marketing data often contain substantial noise, so perfect prediction is neither expected nor required for managerial usefulness. 13.6 Predicted Probabilities Coefficients and classification tables are not always the most intuitive outputs for decision-makers. Predicted probabilities translate model results into directly interpretable quantities. We use the pp_std_mnl() function from the MKT4320BGSU package to compute and visualize average predicted probabilities for a focal predictor. Usage: pp_std_mnl(model, focal, xlab = NULL, ft_table = FALSE) where: model is a fitted multinom model. focal is a character string; name of the focal predictor variable. xlab is an optional character string; label for the x-axis in the plot. ft_table is logical; if TRUE, return the probability table as a flextable (default = FALSE).

Which brands are most sensitive to changes in a given variable? 13.7 Marketing Interpretation The standard multinomial logit model provides a powerful yet accessible framework for understanding brand choice. It allows marketers to: Compare competitive positioning across brands Assess price and promotion sensitivity Translate statistical estimates into actionable probabilities However, it also has limitations, including restrictive substitution patterns across alternatives. 13.8 Summary In this chapter, you learned how to: Estimate a standard multinomial logit model Evaluate model fit and predictive performance Interpret coefficients and relative risk ratios Use predicted probabilities for marketing insight The standard MNL model serves as a foundational tool in marketing analytics and provides a benchmark against which more advanced choice models can be compared. 13.9 What’s Next In this chapter, we treated brand choice as a function of consumer-level characteristics and marketing variables that affect all alternatives in the same way. This approach works well as a baseline, but it imposes an important limitation: it assumes that predictors influence every brand symmetrically. In the next chapter, we relax this restriction by introducing the alternative-specific multinomial logit (AS-MNL) model. This framework allows predictors—such as price, promotions, or product attributes—to vary by brand, more closely reflecting how consumers actually evaluate competing options. You will learn how to: - Specify predictors that differ across alternatives - Interpret coefficients that are specific to each brand - Compare alternative-specific results to the standard MNL model - Gain deeper insight into competitive positioning and substitution patterns Alternative-specific MNL models provide a major step forward in realism and interpretability, especially in marketing settings where attributes like price, availability, or features differ meaningfully across brands.

In the last chapter, we modeled brand choice using standard multinomial logit (MNL) models, where all predictors were case-specific. That is, they described the consumer or choice situation and took the same value for all brands in a given choice set. In many real marketing applications, however, the most important predictors vary by brand. Examples include: Price of each brand Package size Sugar content or nutritional attributes Promotional indicators Brand-specific features Alternative-specific multinomial logit (AS-MNL) models allow us to include these variables directly, providing richer managerial insight into how brand attributes drive choice. In this chapter, you will learn how to: Work with long-format choice data Split alternative-specific data correctly into training and test samples Estimate an alternative-specific MNL model Evaluate model fit and classification performance Interpret predicted probabilities and marginal effects in a marketing context Throughout the chapter, we will use the yogurt dataset. 14.2 The Yogurt Choice Data The yogurt dataset records consumer brand choices in repeated choice situations. Each row represents one alternative within one choice situation, not a single consumer. Key implications: Each choice situation appears multiple times (once per brand) Exactly one alternative is chosen per choice set Many predictors vary across brands within the same choice set This “long” structure is required for alternative-specific MNL models and differs from the wide-format data used earlier in the course. 14.3 Preparing the Data for Modeling 14.3.1 Why Splitting Is Different for Choice Data With alternative-specific data, we cannot randomly split rows into training and test sets. Doing so would break apart choice sets and contaminate model evaluation. Instead, we must split at the choice-set level, ensuring that all rows belonging to the same choice situation stay together. 14.3.2 Creating Training and Test Samples We still use the splitsample() function from the MKT4320BGSU package, which supports group-level splitting. Whereas before we didn’t use several parameters, will will use them for alternative specific MNL. Usage: splitsample(data, outcome = NULL, group = NULL, choice = NULL, alt = NULL, p = 0.75, seed = 4320) where: data is the data frame to split, in long-format. outcome is NOT (USUALLY) USED FOR ALTERNATIVE SPECIFIC MNL group is the grouping variable (e.g., choice situation id or respondent id). If provided, splitting is done at the group level. Required for alternative specific MNL. choice is the 0/1 (or TRUE/FALSE) indicator for the chosen alternative. Used only when group is provided. Required for alternative specific MNL. alt is the optional alternative label/ID. Used with choice to stratify at the group level. Required for alternative specific MNL. p is the proportion of observations to place in the training set. Must be strictly between 0 and 1. Default is 0.75. seed is the random seed for reproducibility. Default is 4320. Before, we were interested in the $train and $test data frames. Now, we are interested in the train.mdata and test.mdata objects that are saved. They are in the format needed for the using mlogit (see below). However, to avoid a console error, you’ll access the a slightly different way. sp &lt;- splitsample(data = yogurt, group = &quot;id&quot;, choice = &quot;choice&quot;, alt = &quot;brand&quot;) train &lt;- sp[[&quot;train.mdata&quot;]] test &lt;- sp[[&quot;test.mdata&quot;]] At this point: train contains complete choice sets for model estimation test contains unseen choice sets for out-of-sample evaluation 14.4 Specifying an Alternative-Specific MNL Model In an alternative-specific MNL model: Case-specific variables enter once Alternative-specific variables enter as brand-varying predictors We use the mlogit function from the mlogit package to estimate the model. We separate the alternative specific from the case specific variables with a |. Alternative specific come first, then the case specific. We can use the base R summary() function to get the raw log-odds estimates. library(mlogit) as_mnl_fit &lt;- mlogit(choice ~ price + feat | income, data = train) summary(as_mnl_fit) Call: mlogit(formula = choice ~ price + feat | income, data = train, method = &quot;nr&quot;) Frequencies of alternatives:choice Dannon Hiland Weight Yoplait 0.401988 0.029818 0.229155 0.339039 nr method 8 iterations, 0h:0m:0s g&#39;(-H)^-1g = 0.000171 successive function values within tolerance limits Coefficients : Estimate Std.

Usage: eval_as_mnl(model, digits = 4, ft = FALSE, newdata = NULL, label_model = \"Model data\", label_newdata = \"New data\", class_digits = 3) where: model is a fitted mlogit model. digits is an integer; decimals to round coefficient and fit results (default 4). ft is logical; if TRUE, return coefficient and classification tables as flextable objects (default FALSE). newdata is an optional dfidx object (e.g., test.mdata) for an additional classification matrix. If NULL, only the training-data matrix is produced. label_model is a character string label for the training-data classification matrix (default “Model data”). label_newdata is a character string label for the newdata classification matrix (default “New data”). class_digits is an integer; decimals to round classification results (default 3).

brand is the one with the highest predicted probability Accuracy reflects correct brand predictions PCC provides a baseline comparison This approach mirrors how managers think about predicting actual consumer choices. 14.6 Predicted Probabilities and Marginal Effects 14.6.1 Why Predicted Probabilities Matter Coefficients are not always intuitive. Predicted probabilities translate the model into outcomes managers care about: Market shares Brand switching Competitive responses 14.6.2 Why Marginal Effects Are Useful Marginal effects quantify how much choice probabilities change in response to a small change in an attribute, holding everything else constant. Marginal effects can be computed in two common ways: At observed values (Average Marginal Effects, AME) Marginal effects are calculated for each observation using its actual attribute values and then averaged. At means (Marginal Effects at the Mean, MEM) Marginal effects are calculated at a single “average” profile, where each attribute is set to its sample mean. Both approaches summarize how sensitive choice probabilities are to changes in attributes, but they differ in interpretation. Marginal effects at observed values: Reflect the full distribution of the data Avoid relying on a potentially unrealistic “average consumer” Are often preferred for descriptive and policy interpretation Marginal effects at means: Are easier to reproduce by hand or with software defaults Provide a clear, single reference point Can be useful for illustrating model mechanics and comparing effects across variables The marginal effects tables can therefore answer questions such as: “On average, how does a $1 increase in price affect brand choice?” “How would choice probabilities change for a typical consumer if an attribute increased slightly?” “Which brands are most sensitive to changes in a specific attribute?” In practice, the choice between observed values and means depends on the goal of the analysis. For interpretation and real-world impact, average marginal effects at observed values are often preferred. For teaching, demonstration, or simplified comparisons, marginal effects at means can be equally informative. 14.6.3 The pp_as_mnl() Function For both case-specific and alternative-specific predictors, we use the pp_as_mnl() function from the MKT4320BGSU package to get both predicted probabilities and marginal effects. Usage: pp_as_mnl(model,focal_var, focal_type = c(\"auto\", \"alt\", \"case\"), grid_n = 25, digits = 4, ft = FALSE, marginal = TRUE, me_method = c(\"observed\", \"means\"), me_step = 1) where: model is a fitted mlogit model. focal_var is a character string name of the focal variable. focal_type is a character string; one of “case”, “alt”, or “auto” (default = “auto”). grid_n is an integer; number of points used to construct the grid of focal values for predicted probability plots when the focal variable is continuous (default = 25). digits is an integer; rounding for numeric output (default = 4). ft is logical; if TRUE, return tables as flextable objects (default = FALSE). marginal is logical; if TRUE, compute marginal effects (default = TRUE). me_method is a character string; one of “observed” AME or “means” (default = “observed”). me_step is numeric; finite-difference step size for AME (default = 1). 14.6.4 Case-Specific Predictors We first examine how a consumer-level variable affects brand choice probabilities. pp_income &lt;- pp_as_mnl(as_mnl_fit, focal_var = &quot;income&quot;, ft = TRUE, me_method=&quot;means&quot;) pp_income$me_table
